Solving it helped me gain better intuition around hash functions, pointers, and memory segments like the stack and the heap.
Basics You have probably encountered a hash table in the wild, like a dict in Python, map in Go, or Map in JavaScript. Hash tables associate a key with a value. Setting, looking up, and deleting values is average O(1) time complexity &amp;ndash; fast.</description></item><item><title>Book Review: The Diamond Age</title><link>https://theleo.zone/books/the-diamond-age/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/books/the-diamond-age/</guid><description>Rating: üëé
Heavily opinionated claims and spoilers ahead.
I did not enjoy and do not recommend The Diamond Age, by Neil Stephenson. It was a particularly disappointing read for me because of how much I enjoyed Snow Crash last month.
The Diamond Age should be called The Rough (Unpolished) Diamond, as this could have been a great book.

My experiences took on a different texture while I read Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson. The hyper-privatized, segmented-but-uniform world in which the plot unfolds gave me greater than usual mistrust for every McDonalds, gated community, and Airport shopping corridor.

A self help book usually acts like a manual for achieving above-average levels of success, wealth, positive mental state, etc., told through parables of the author&amp;rsquo;s life.
What qualities do we find distasteful in self help books?

And str implements __iter__(), e.g.:

Writing in &amp;ldquo;assembly&amp;rdquo; is one step down from writing in something like C - there is no automatic memory management, only a couple registers to play with, lots of referencing addresses with pointers and semi-roundabout ways of doing things.</description></item><item><title>RC 02 (R, wavey!)</title><link>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-02-r-wavey/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-02-r-wavey/</guid><description>This week, I completed project 3 of Nand2Tetris, learned some deeper fundamentals of statistical learning in R, and wrote my first interactive thing in D3.
D3.js is a widely used javascript library for creating beautiful, interactive visualizations on the web. I made quite a simple interactive sine wave plotter, but the exercise took hours and really helped me gain insight in to D3&amp;rsquo;s declarative approach to data-centric object manipulation. Code for the thing here.</description></item><item><title>RC 01 (logic immunity)</title><link>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-01-logic-immunity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-01-logic-immunity/</guid><description>I have been learning about basic computer architecture (logic gates) and working on a herd immunity simulation.
Computer architecture work has come from the awesome Nand2Tetris course by Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan. Shimon has a fantastic Ted Talk about the course and many Recursers have done it in the past. I&amp;rsquo;m 2 projects in to the first half of the course (Coursera link)
The premise is that you start with a Nand (&amp;ldquo;Not And&amp;rdquo;) logic gate.</description></item><item><title>jupyter with docker</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/jupyter-with-docker/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/jupyter-with-docker/</guid><description>I love docker. It makes environments:
portable across any machine subject to version control (retraceable and recoverable history) easily deployed and discarded with simple commands Jupyter is a great tool that allows for the creation of nice looking documents consisting of ordered code chunks with inline output. It is a fantastic way to get started with programming, clearly step through your workflow, and/or create stories and presentations out of your work.</description></item><item><title>RC 00 (it begins)</title><link>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-00-it-begins/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-00-it-begins/</guid><description>It is day 3 at the Recurse Center (RC)!
Me experimenting with Haskell and Rust It has been a whirlwind of orientation, meeting awesome people, learning about (and about the existence of) new cool things, setting up and settling in.
This was my second day here:
8-9am: Research blogging tools to create this very website. Decide on Jekyll + github pages + namecheap domain as a good solution 9-10am: Update MacOS to Mojave after experiencing ruby-related jekyll issues 10-11am: Using this great tutorial, get jekyll and bundler installed.</description></item><item><title>about me</title><link>https://theleo.zone/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/about/</guid><description>A small collection of real and questionably real endorsements:
We just watched your presentation on Wander on YouTube. We are both proud and baffled. Proud of your work and your fluent ability to speak a new English. Baffled because we feel a bit like having been dropped into a Helsinki lecture theatre listening to an eloquent prof speaking in faultless Finnish. Like your comments it would be lovely to the ears and practically meaningless to the mind.</description></item><item><title>Hansel &amp; Gretel's Internet Lounge</title><link>https://theleo.zone/hansel-and-gretel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/hansel-and-gretel/</guid><description>üéâ UPDATE üéâ
Hansel &amp;amp; Gretel have been adopted into a loving home!!!
You really couldn&amp;rsquo;t ask for better cats.
Gretel is the shorter haired tortoiseshell cat. She is an explorative cuddler who will paw at your arm gently if you stop petting her too early.
Hansel is a sprawl-in-your-lap kinda guy. A black furry boy, he sheds surprisingly little and is sleek, clean, and has beautiful orange eyes.</description></item><item><title>Jerald Chaim "Jerry" Robinovitch</title><link>https://theleo.zone/jerry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/jerry/</guid><description>Stories and images from Jerry&amp;rsquo;s ninth life, lived from April 23, 2021 to May 28, 2022 I wanted a cat. My new apartment allowed them, and they are pretty neat. A friend recommended Jerry, a 15 year old orange boy from the SPCA. I had already applied for him.
Prior Jerry adoption applicants had been deterred by his various medical conditions. Stage one kidney failure, heart murmur, just had some teeth pulled and benign lumps removed&amp;hellip;sounds like a hassle.</description></item><item><title>Phoenix's Tumblr Page</title><link>https://theleo.zone/phoenix/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/phoenix/</guid><description>üéâ UPDATE üéâ
Phoenix has been adopted into a loving home!!!
Phoenix is an old girl who has come here to cuddle you and eat food. And she&amp;rsquo;s all out of food.
She is incredibly sweet, with a deep love for head bumps and neck scritches. She sleeps on my bed at my feet and doesn&amp;rsquo;t disturb my slumber. She&amp;rsquo;s a bit overweight and does a funny little booty wiggle before hopping up on the couch or bed.</description></item></channel></rss>
