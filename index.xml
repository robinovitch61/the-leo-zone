The Scout Mindset is a book by Julia Galef. It introduces the concept of &amp;ldquo;Scout mindset&amp;rdquo;, contrasted with &amp;ldquo;Soldier mindset&amp;rdquo;. A Soldier mindset is present when our unconscious motives affect the conclusions we draw. A Scout seeks to continually align their perceptions closer to reality.
If directionally motivated reasoning is like being a soldier fighting off threatening evidence, accuracy motivated reasoning is like being a scout forming a map of the strategic landscape.</description></item><item><title>Book Review: The Murderbot Diaries</title><link>https://theleo.zone/books/murderbot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/books/murderbot/</guid><description>Rating:ü´®
The Murderbot Diaries is a series by Martha Wells. I would say it is in the Sci-Fi genre but also teen angst and also whatever genre the movie Gladiator is in.
To preface this review, I have only read the first 3 novels in this series (there are 7 books at the time of this writing). I also read this in an extremely busy period of life where I would read 1-3 pages at a time at night before falling asleep.</description></item><item><title>unhealthy database migrations</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/unhealthy-db-migrations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/unhealthy-db-migrations/</guid><description>Often, integration tests follow this pattern:

The Mindbody Prescription: Healing the Body, Healing the Pain is a book by John Sarno, a doctor and author who was known for coining Tension Myositis Syndrome (TMS), a condition that manifests as many different forms of chronic pain.
I had heard the name Sarno in internet conversations around back pain, but he came up again when I was talking with a friend about my typing pain and he mentioned that he had read a kind of wacky book (this one) about pain treatment when he was experiencing the same thing and his pain went away after reading it and he never thinks about it anymore.</description></item><item><title>pdf-ify a website</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/pdf-ify-a-website/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/pdf-ify-a-website/</guid><description>I love writing a bit of code at the airport gate.

The Devil in the White City is a book by Erik Larson about the 1893 World&amp;rsquo;s Columbian Exposition (&amp;ldquo;the fair&amp;rdquo;) in Chicago. It follows two main characters: Daniel Burnham, the fair&amp;rsquo;s primary architect, and H. H. Holmes, a serial killer who operated during the time of the fair.
I&amp;rsquo;m a bit late to the party on this one. It was big after it came out in 2003, and my mom recommended it to me at least 5 years ago, but 2023 seems like my year of Chicago - watching The Bear, putting together that something like 20% of my friends are from Chicago, and now this book.</description></item><item><title>customizing the Glove80 keyboard with ZMK</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/configuring-glove80/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/configuring-glove80/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been dealing with some wrist/hand/forearm pain from typing.

Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow (T3) is a novel by Gabrielle Zevin.
I really enjoyed this book, ripping through it on my flight and subsequent jetlagged morning as I move back from London to the West Coast. Spoilers ahead.

Zevin mentions some influences in her author&amp;rsquo;s note at the end, and summarizes that the book is about Work and it is about Love, and that struck me as a good summary.</description></item><item><title>Book Review: The Light of All That Falls</title><link>https://theleo.zone/books/the-light-of-all-that-falls/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/books/the-light-of-all-that-falls/</guid><description>Rating:üî¶
The Light of All That Falls is the third and final book in The Licanius Trilogy, a fantasy series by James Islington.

An Echo of Things to Come is the second book in The Licanius Trilogy, a fantasy series by James Islington.

The Shadow of What Was Lost is the first book in The Licanius Trilogy, a fantasy series by James Islington.
I really enjoyed this book. As usual, spoilers ahead.
The setting in this book feels huge. It&amp;rsquo;s like a Marvel Movie in High fantasy format, seriously, it&amp;rsquo;s a super hero book more than a fantasy book.

Recurse is over! It happened! What an excellent time.
I got a lot out of projects, reading, meet ups, interviewing and online courses. The study and research was varied and rewarding.
In the end, though, I got as much or more from being around the people at RC as the individual study.</description></item><item><title>RC 10 (work)</title><link>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-10-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-10-work/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Chad, destroyer of worlds&amp;#39; - circa 2015 My second to last week at RC was first spent in San Francisco at onsite interviews for positions in the city. Interviews went well and I had a nice time seeing some friends while there.
Unfortunately, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough time to finish the compiler of nand2tetris! The first week where I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished my nand2tetris project :&amp;rsquo;(. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try my best to finish up both the compiler and OS this final week, though!</description></item><item><title>RC 09 (ŒªŒµŒæŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ)</title><link>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-09-%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%BE%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CE%BD/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-09-%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%BE%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CE%BD/</guid><description>In my third to last week of RC (!!!), I learned about Nix, Jest for Test Driven Development in Javascript, completed project 10 of nand2tetris, and continued interview prep.
Project 10 consists of the first half of the Jack compiler. The overall compiler is split in to tokenization + lexical analysis (project 10) and VM code generation (project 11).
The first half of the compiler was the most time consuming project of the course so far.</description></item><item><title>RC 08 (mooninites)</title><link>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-08-mooninites/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-08-mooninites/</guid><description>Aqua Teen Hunger Force&amp;#39;s Mooninites This week, I completed Nand2Tetris project 9, wrote about Givewell, and continued interview prep.
Nand2Tetris&amp;rsquo; gets you used to programming in the high-level &amp;ldquo;Jack&amp;rdquo; programming language. It would be difficult (or at least, less meaningful) to write a compiler for a high level language that you don&amp;rsquo;t really understand.
I found it useful in that it solidified the rules of Jack and allowed me to project my thoughts of what the compiler would be doing to translate Jack code to VM Code.</description></item><item><title>givewell is awesome</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/givewell-is-awesome/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/givewell-is-awesome/</guid><description>Note: this is my personal commentary and this post is not officially endorsed by Givewell in any way.
Givewell is one of the most admirable philanthropic organizations out there. They recognize and act upon a number of important truths:
Money is a super powerful tool for reducing harm in the world Money can be used in more and less effective ways The effectiveness of money can be modeled with finite (possibly wide) uncertainty bounds at a non-trivial confidence level Encouraging those with the means to donate money to effective causes is important and worthwhile Moral judgement is an inseparable part of judging the effectiveness of an outcome Not only does Givewell maintain an active blog, a Giving 101 section of its site, run free events in the Bay Area every few months and deliver well-curated email updates, but they keep updated copies of their Cost Effectiveness Models and Guide to Cost Effective Analysis available online for everyone to view.</description></item><item><title>RC 07 (fib 5 ways)</title><link>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-07-fib-5-ways/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-07-fib-5-ways/</guid><description>Recurse continues!
Each successive number in the Fibonacci Sequence is the sum of the two prior numbers:

One satisfying thing about this course has been consistently connecting the &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; implementations that the course outlines to the hyper complex implementations in the real world.
Project 7 outlined the idea of multi-stage compilation. Take a high level language and compile it to a &amp;ldquo;Virtual Machine Code&amp;rdquo;, with readable but lower level syntax. This &amp;ldquo;intermediate representation&amp;rdquo; can then be compiled further through assembly to machine code (the 1s and 0s) for a specific hardware platform (e.</description></item><item><title>RC 05 (your biggest weakness)</title><link>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-05-your-biggest-weakness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-05-your-biggest-weakness/</guid><description>80,000 Hours is a non-profit that researches the world&amp;rsquo;s most pressing problems and provides guidance on how to make an impact on them with your career.

It is a complex domain in itself, with major contributions from database development, machine learning, distributed application deployment, and academia.
Python requires a clear and simple concurrency framework as it is commonly used in high-compute settings like training neural networks.

The Mandelbrot set with Rust Source: http://downloads.codecoding.com/rust/Programming%20Rust.pdf While I started learning Rust with the the O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Book, I&amp;rsquo;ve found The Rust Programming Language and Rustlings to be great resources as well.

Nand2Tetris project 4 breaks away from the Hardware Description Language of the first three projects and moves in to a pseudo assembly code. This assembly language is specifically written for the &amp;ldquo;Hack&amp;rdquo; computer that the class builds up through the first six projects. Writing in &amp;ldquo;assembly&amp;rdquo; is one step down from writing in something like C - there is no automatic memory management, only a couple registers to play with, lots of referencing addresses with pointers and semi-roundabout ways of doing things.</description></item><item><title>RC 02 (R, wavey!)</title><link>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-02-r-wavey/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-02-r-wavey/</guid><description>This week, I completed project 3 of Nand2Tetris, learned some deeper fundamentals of statistical learning in R, and wrote my first interactive thing in D3.
