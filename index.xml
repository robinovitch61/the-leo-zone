We orchestrate distributed energy resources-large-scale electricity users, residential consumers, batteries, and generators-to make the electric grid more resilient and pay our customers well.
This is the story of migrating one hundred microservices from self-managed Kafka in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) to Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK).
Initial State Kafka was introduced to the Voltus tech stack in 2019 and quickly became a critical piece of infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>setting up tidal cycles</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/tidal-cycles-setup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/tidal-cycles-setup/</guid><description>Tidal Cycles is software that works on top of another piece of software called SuperCollider.
Together, you can use them to produce music using code.
Today I set up these tools and made my first sound with them. Setup was a bit tricky, and this post is as much for myself to document what I did as it is for others pursuing their own setup in the future.
The first step is to install SuperCollider, following the install links for your platform at supercollider.</description></item><item><title>cron: for your health</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/cron-for-your-health/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/cron-for-your-health/</guid><description>I have a standing desk, but rarely stand. I have probably been sitting about 7 hours a day, which is too much! In the spirit of positive nudges for habit building and taking ownership over my notifications, I wrote a simple cron job to remind me to stand up every hour.

You can run it with node installed or in a docker container.
I like having a Typescript-ready environment without having to spinup a new react app or something. CodeSandbox was nice, but got pretty laggy at times and was hard to version control. Gluing together some tooling to scratch my own itch was fun.</description></item><item><title>rodney mullen and mastery</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/rodney-mullen-and-mastery/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 14:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/rodney-mullen-and-mastery/</guid><description>Today, I fell asleep on the couch watching youtube and woke up halfway through a Rodney Mullen documentary.
Rodney Mullen, like Simone Biles in gymnastics or Derren Brown in magic, is one of the best that will ever be in their domain. World champ at 14, inventor of the ollie and kickflip, a laundry list of other accolades&amp;hellip;there&amp;rsquo;s not much to dispute.
The podium finishers at the olympics this year in Skateboarding, while insanely skilled, won their medals doing stuff that doesn&amp;rsquo;t look much different than what Mullen was doing in the 80&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item><item><title>verbify your arrows</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/verbify-your-arrows/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2021 22:36:07 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/verbify-your-arrows/</guid><description>This is a diagram from an open source project I was evaluating at work recently, and the subsequent conversations I had:

About 6 weeks ago, I launched colorcontroversy.com. Since then, the site has collected over 800,000 color judgements and been shared around the web more than I expected.
A much-simplified version of Randal Monroe of XKCD&amp;rsquo;s color survey, the site shows you a color shade and presents two color choices for that shade.

Recurse is over! It happened! What an excellent time.
I got a lot out of projects, reading, meet ups, interviewing and online courses. The study and research was varied and rewarding.
In the end, though, I got as much or more from being around the people at RC as the individual study.</description></item><item><title>RC 10 (work)</title><link>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-10-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-10-work/</guid><description>&amp;#39;Chad, destroyer of worlds&amp;#39; - circa 2015 My second to last week at RC was first spent in San Francisco at onsite interviews for positions in the city.

Unfortunately, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough time to finish the compiler of nand2tetris! The first week where I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished my nand2tetris project :&amp;rsquo;(.

Project 10 consists of the first half of the Jack compiler. The overall compiler is split in to tokenization + lexical analysis (project 10) and VM code generation (project 11).
The first half of the compiler was the most time consuming project of the course so far.</description></item><item><title>RC 08 (mooninites)</title><link>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-08-mooninites/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-08-mooninites/</guid><description>Aqua Teen Hunger Force&amp;#39;s Mooninites This week, I completed Nand2Tetris project 9, wrote about Givewell, and continued interview prep.
Nand2Tetris&amp;rsquo; gets you used to programming in the high-level &amp;ldquo;Jack&amp;rdquo; programming language. It would be difficult (or at least, less meaningful) to write a compiler for a high level language that you don&amp;rsquo;t really understand.
I found it useful in that it solidified the rules of Jack and allowed me to project my thoughts of what the compiler would be doing to translate Jack code to VM Code.</description></item><item><title>givewell is awesome</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/givewell-is-awesome/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/givewell-is-awesome/</guid><description>Note: this is my personal commentary and this post is not officially endorsed by Givewell in any way.
Givewell is one of the most admirable philanthropic organizations out there. They recognize and act upon a number of important truths:
Money is a super powerful tool for reducing harm in the world Money can be used in more and less effective ways The effectiveness of money can be modeled with finite (possibly wide) uncertainty bounds at a non-trivial confidence level Encouraging those with the means to donate money to effective causes is important and worthwhile Moral judgement is an inseparable part of judging the effectiveness of an outcome Not only does Givewell maintain an active blog, a Giving 101 section of its site, run free events in the Bay Area every few months and deliver well-curated email updates, but they keep updated copies of their Cost Effectiveness Models and Guide to Cost Effective Analysis available online for everyone to view.</description></item><item><title>RC 07 (fib 5 ways)</title><link>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-07-fib-5-ways/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-07-fib-5-ways/</guid><description>Recurse continues!

One satisfying thing about this course has been consistently connecting the &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; implementations that the course outlines to the hyper complex implementations in the real world.
Project 7 outlined the idea of multi-stage compilation. Take a high level language and compile it to a &amp;ldquo;Virtual Machine Code&amp;rdquo;, with readable but lower level syntax. This &amp;ldquo;intermediate representation&amp;rdquo; can then be compiled further through assembly to machine code (the 1s and 0s) for a specific hardware platform (e.</description></item><item><title>RC 05 (your biggest weakness)</title><link>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-05-your-biggest-weakness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-05-your-biggest-weakness/</guid><description>80,000 Hours is a non-profit that researches the world&amp;rsquo;s most pressing problems and provides guidance on how to make an impact on them with your career.

Nand2Tetris project 4 breaks away from the Hardware Description Language of the first three projects and moves in to a pseudo assembly code. This assembly language is specifically written for the &amp;ldquo;Hack&amp;rdquo; computer that the class builds up through the first six projects. Writing in &amp;ldquo;assembly&amp;rdquo; is one step down from writing in something like C - there is no automatic memory management, only a couple registers to play with, lots of referencing addresses with pointers and semi-roundabout ways of doing things.</description></item><item><title>RC 02 (R, wavey!)</title><link>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-02-r-wavey/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/recurse/rc-02-r-wavey/</guid><description>This week, I completed project 3 of Nand2Tetris, learned some deeper fundamentals of statistical learning in R, and wrote my first interactive thing in D3.
