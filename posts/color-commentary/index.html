Since then, the site has collected over 800,000 color judgements and been shared around the web more than I expected.</p><p>A much-simplified version of Randal Monroe of XKCD&rsquo;s <a href=https://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/>color survey</a>, the site shows you a color shade and presents two color choices for that shade. For example, it shows you a <span style=color:#00878e>dark turquoise</span> and asks you if it&rsquo;s <span style=color:#32cd32>Green</span> or <span style=color:#547cff>Blue</span>. Then it shows you what other people thought it was.</p><a class=img-link target=_blank href=/img/turquoise-result.png><figure><img style=max-width:70% src=/img/turquoise-result.png alt=turquoise-result.png></figure></a><p>This the first thing I&rsquo;ve put out there that I wanted lots of random people to use and enjoy. I learned a lot from building it, some of which is discussed below.</p><h2 id=dont-design-in-htmlcss>don&rsquo;t design in html/css</h2><p>Unless you&rsquo;re <a href=https://lynnandtonic.com/>Lynn Fisher</a>, it can be pretty difficult to translate designs from your head immediately into code. This is obvious to any designer or artistic person, but these things I am not.</p><a class=img-link target=_blank href=/img/figma-cc-mobile.png><figure><img style=max-width:70% src=/img/figma-cc-mobile.png alt=figma-cc-mobile.png><figcaption class=figcaption-text>Note the original skull logo</figcaption></figure></a><p>Turns out clicking and dragging is a lot easier than CSS when in ideation. The mocks were mostly done before I wrote a line of code. I was able to get feedback from friends on a real-looking site without any serious up-front investment.</p><h2 id=sign-up-isnt-just-for-data-collection>sign up isn&rsquo;t just for data collection</h2><p>The things that take my breath away on the internet almost always load and immerse quickly. A <a href=https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/>fluid simulation</a> or a <a href=https://www.pixelthoughts.co/>peaceful meditation</a> - no sign up flow, no pop ups or ads, no cookie consent required, nothing between you and the experience.</p><p>Notably, the examples above deliver the entire content to the users&rsquo; browser up front, then no further interaction with the internet is required.</p><p>Color Controversy does not behave this way. It collects repeated user input and persists it in a far-away server. So what if someone wants to spam the site with repeated requests from an automated script? What if someone wants to DDoS the site just for the LuLz?</p><p>A h4ck3r would have nothing to gain from doing this, but I felt I should operate in the &ldquo;whatever users can do, they will do&rdquo; mindset. I could have embedded a unique token in the browser that the user would automatically include in their data submission when operating the site as intended, but how to obtain the token in a way some script couldn&rsquo;t reproduce fairly easily?</p><p>When it comes down to it, deterrence for malicious action is limited without user-specific identification, i.e. sign up and login. Turns out there&rsquo;s more to sign up than just pernicious data collection for profit!</p><p>Sign up and login were a deal breaker for me user-experience wise, so what I settled for was implementing server-side <a href=https://github.com/robinovitch61/color-controversy/blob/master/backups/backup.sh>periodic backups of the database</a> with the knowledge that I could at least restore the data to a valid state if someone did decide to mess with it. Luckily, this hasn&rsquo;t been necessary so far.</p><h2 id=done-is-better-than-perfect>done is better than perfect</h2><p>Could I have worked harder to figure out how to get the play-swagger plugin to parse my Enum color values so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to replicate them manually on the frontend? Yes.</p><p>Is the color label text sometimes a little cut off on color labels on the results chart when the color is medium-controversial? Yes.</p><p>Are two different docker-compose files, one for dev and one for prod, the best way to do something resembling dev ops? Could I have pushed my built images to remote storage to avoid rebuilding them locally every time? Could I have figured out how to get my Scala Play container to compile and run on less RAM and saved a few dollars a month on AWS costs? Yes, yes, and yes.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s done! It works! People use it, and no one has submitted angry github issues denigrating my intelligence. In fact, I got my <a href=https://github.com/robinovitch61/color-controversy>first 3 github stars</a> on the project! I love it as is and am ready to move on.</p><h2 id=design-data-collection-early>design data collection early</h2><p>I did something really smart and/or really dumb in designing the data model for Color Controversy.</p><p>I decided that the database would never grow past its <a href=https://github.com/robinovitch61/color-controversy/blob/master/postgres/init.sql>original number of rows</a> - color submissions simply trigger a SQL query that mutates one of the values in the row of that color:</p><div class=highlight><div style=-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><table style=border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0><tr><td style=vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0><pre tabindex=0 style=-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code><span style="white-space:pre;user-select:none;margin-right:.4em;padding:0 .4em;color:#7f7f7f">1

No indexing or normalization required when you only have ~100 rows of data 😎.</p><p>Unfortunately, someone online pointed out soon after launch that it would have made for some interesting data to collect a little more than just color judgements. Browser usage, mobile/tablet/desktop, general location and time of day along with judgement made makes for some interesting data analysis after the fact.</p><p>Fortunately, completely by accident, I can pretty much parse all this out of the Nginx logs, which I started backing up periodically soon after I realized my mistake. They are sitting around ready for me to sift through at some future time.</p><p>Unfortunately, now I&rsquo;m sort of treating logs like a read-only database, and I maybe could have just designed this in to my Postgres schema in the first place without taking much of a performance hit. You win some, you lose some.</p><h2 id=put-your-stuff-out-there>put your stuff out there</h2><p>The internet is cool and building dumb stuff is fun. Making for the web is also kind of terrifying, because it&rsquo;s probably going to be around for a long time. Once you unleash it, it&rsquo;s out there, ready for judgement and criticism.
