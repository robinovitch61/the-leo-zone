decoding it, we managed to cope at all. The main sensation of the newcomer was that he was participating in a miracle
which he was entirely incapable of comprehending.</p><p>- <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Milner-Barry>Stuart Milner-Barry</a>, Codebreaker at Bletchley Park</p></blockquote><p>One of my highest priority trips while living in London this year was visiting <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park>Bletchley Park</a>. I&rsquo;d seen
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game>The Imitation Game</a> and knew a few things about <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing>Alan Turing</a> within the context of the history
of computing, so I had a strong sense that Bletchley Park would be a special place to visit in real life.</p><p>Bletchley Park was home base for the Allied code breaking operation during World War II. According to Historian <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Hinsley>Harry
Hinsley</a>, the intel out of Bletchley &ldquo;shortened the war by not less that two years and probably by four years&rdquo;
(<a href=https://www.cix.co.uk/~klockstone/hinsley.htm>source</a>). At peak, it employed almost 9000 people - Mathematicians, Linguists, Cryptographers, Typists,
Historians, Translators, Cooks, Dispatch Riders (motorcyclists who carried classified intel between locations),
Librarians, Musicians, and many others. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Bletchley_Park>Three-quarters of them were women</a>.</p><p>After the war, most of the original physical documents and machines from Bletchley Park were destroyed. Information
about it remained heavily classified. It wasn&rsquo;t until the &rsquo;70s that the world started to know the full nature of the
work that was done there from 1938 to 1946. Work on some ciphers wasn&rsquo;t declassified until the 21st century!</p><p>Bletchley Park reopened as a museum in &lsquo;93. The original mansion and huts where the codebreakers did most of their work
remain intact, and there are now recreations of many other artifacts. The museum is lovely, with a lot of interactive
elements, informative tours, and a very high volume of content. Five hours in a single day wasn&rsquo;t enough to explore it
fully. I&rsquo;ll share some of my photos and main recollections, but you should definitely go at least once if you have the
chance!</p><a class=img-link target=_blank href=./img/entrance_sign.png><figure><img loading=lazy style=max-width:50% src=./img/entrance_sign.png alt=./img/entrance_sign.png><figcaption class=figcaption-text>The Entrance to Bletchley Park</figcaption></figure></a><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_service>Y-stations</a> intercepted 3,000 to 20,000 messages daily from radio traffic which, if encrypted, were then
hand-delivered or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter>teleprinted</a> to Bletchley Park. Then came the task of deciphering the encrypted messages, which is
what so much of the literature focuses on. Once that day&rsquo;s cipher settings were worked out for a given machine (e.g.
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine>Enigma</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_cipher>Lorenz</a>, or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_B_Cipher_Machine>Purple</a>), the mechanical task of deciphering all of the messages with modified <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typex>Typex</a> machines
was completed. Then came translation (e.g. German to English), cross-referencing, and sending out the intel &ndash; code
named &ldquo;Ultra&rdquo; &ndash; to relevant strategic parties. Ultra couldn&rsquo;t be used unless there was a viable cover story for how
they had obtained the intel, as it was vital to keep the Axis powers believing that their ciphers remained unbroken.</p><a class=img-link target=_blank href=./img/mod_typex.png><figure><img loading=lazy style=max-width:50% src=./img/mod_typex.png alt=./img/mod_typex.png><figcaption class=figcaption-text>British Typex machines modified to mimic Enigma</figcaption></figure></a><a class=img-link target=_blank href=./img/lorenz.png><figure><img loading=lazy style=max-width:50% src=./img/lorenz.png alt=./img/lorenz.png><figcaption class=figcaption-text>A Lorenz machine, the successor to Enigma</figcaption></figure></a><p>At Bletchley, the main mansion and breakout huts were busy with folks carrying out these tasks.

mansion were reserved for leisure and activities, like the Ballroom, Tennis Courts and the Drama club, which put on more
than 20 performances through the years.</p><a class=img-link target=_blank href=./img/ballroom.png><figure><img loading=lazy style=max-width:50% src=./img/ballroom.png alt=./img/ballroom.png><figcaption class=figcaption-text>The Ballroom</figcaption></figure></a><a class=img-link target=_blank href=./img/mansion.png><figure><img loading=lazy style=max-width:80% src=./img/mansion.png alt=./img/mansion.png><figcaption class=figcaption-text>The Mansion</figcaption></figure></a><a class=img-link target=_blank href=./img/office.png><figure><img loading=lazy style=max-width:80% src=./img/office.png alt=./img/office.png><figcaption class=figcaption-text>The Main Office</figcaption></figure></a><a class=img-link target=_blank href=./img/newspaper_purchase.png><figure><img loading=lazy style=max-width:50% src=./img/newspaper_purchase.png alt=./img/newspaper_purchase.png><figcaption class=figcaption-text>"Government Buy Park" - 1938</figcaption></figure></a><p>The people who worked there were extremely diverse, ranging from fairly unkempt nerds to military commanders. <a href=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/6197169/JRR-Tolkien-trained-as-British-spy.html>Tolkein</a>
was on the list of emergency recruits for Bletchley, but declined. Hierarchy and bureaucracy emerged as the years went
on, but there was a remarkably flat and self-directed structure for most of the years of Bletchley Park&rsquo;s operation.</p><a class=img-link target=_blank href=./img/memos.png><figure><img loading=lazy style=max-width:70% src=./img/memos.png alt=./img/memos.png><figcaption class=figcaption-text>A wall of sampled memos from Bletchley Park</figcaption></figure></a><a class=img-link target=_blank href=./img/wrens.png><figure><img loading=lazy style=max-width:80% src=./img/wrens.png alt=./img/wrens.png><figcaption class=figcaption-text>Women's Royal Navy Service operatives ("Wrens")</figcaption></figure></a><p>Years before folks at Bletchley started working to crack Enigma, three Polish mathematician-cryptologists had already
made significant progress. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_Rejewski>Marian Rejewsky</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_R%C3%B3%C5%BCycki>Jerzy Różycki</a>, and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henryk_Zygalski>Henryk Zygalski</a>, working
for the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_Bureau_(Poland)>Polish Cipher Bureau</a>, reconstructed the Enigma machine from limited French military
intelligence. In 1939, they met the French and British at a conference in Warsaw and shared their intel, including
copies of the reconstructed Enigma machine. Rejewsky also invented the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomba_(cryptography)>bomba kryptologiczna</a> in order to speed
up the decipherment process. There is a powerful memorial to these men at the Bletchley Park museum.</p><a class=img-link target=_blank href=./img/polish_bomba.png><figure><img loading=lazy style=max-width:50% src=./img/polish_bomba.png alt=./img/polish_bomba.png><figcaption class=figcaption-text>A recreation of a Polish "Bomba"</figcaption></figure></a><a class=img-link target=_blank href=./img/polish_plaque.png><figure><img loading=lazy style=max-width:80% src=./img/polish_plaque.png alt=./img/polish_plaque.png><figcaption class=figcaption-text>A Plaque to the Polish codebreakers</figcaption></figure></a><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing>Alan Turing</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Welchman>Gordon Welchman</a> improved on the Poles&rsquo; design to adapt to Enigma&rsquo;s latest design
and operational changes. Using the fact that Enigma never enciphered a character as itself and that parts of the cipher
text could be guessed (&ldquo;cribs&rdquo;), they designed huge mechanized <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe>Bombe</a> machines that were then built by the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Tabulating_Machine_Company>British
Tabulating Machine Company</a>. Starting in 1940, Bombes began breaking messages regularly, and more and more
machines were manufactured and spread around to outstations in order to avoid losing all of them at once in an air raid.
The Bombes were configured and operated by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Bletchley_Park>Wrens</a> according to a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe#Bombe_menu>menus</a>, which tested a crib against a
piece of ciphertext in order to determine the machine settings that produced that text.</p><a class=img-link target=_blank href=./img/bombe_blueprints.png><figure><img loading=lazy style=max-width:80% src=./img/bombe_blueprints.png alt=./img/bombe_blueprints.png><figcaption class=figcaption-text>Bombe Blueprints</figcaption></figure></a><a class=img-link target=_blank href=./img/bombe_draft.png><figure><img loading=lazy style=max-width:80% src=./img/bombe_draft.png alt=./img/bombe_draft.png><figcaption class=figcaption-text>Bombe Draft</figcaption></figure></a><a class=img-link target=_blank href=./img/dial.png><figure><img loading=lazy style=max-width:80% src=./img/dial.png alt=./img/dial.png><figcaption class=figcaption-text>One of the Enigma dials</figcaption></figure></a><a class=img-link target=_blank href=./img/model_bombe.png><figure><img loading=lazy style=max-width:80% src=./img/model_bombe.png alt=./img/model_bombe.png><figcaption class=figcaption-text>A reconstructed working Bombe machine</figcaption></figure></a><p>Work at Bletchley also lead to the world&rsquo;s first programmable computer: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer>Colossus</a>.
