I think the sites are fun, relatively unique gifts. As a bonus serve, they illustrate some of my progression with basic html/css/javascript static websites.</p><h2 id=site-1-averyrobinscomhttpswwwaveryrobinscom>Site 1: <a href=https://www.averyrobins.com>averyrobins.com</a></h2><a class=img-link target=_blank href=/img/averyrobins.png><figure><img style=max-width:100% src=/img/averyrobins.png alt=averyrobins.png></figure></a><p>I set up an Amazon S3 bucket for static hosting, bought a namecheap domain name, configured the custom DNS, and voila - I now pay $1/month to host this profanity-laden ASCII art. 90% of the time went to setting up, hosting and routing the content - I spent about 20mins on the actual index.html file.</p><p>When my content first appeared when I typed <a href=https://averyrobins.com>averyrobins.com</a> in to my browser, I was so stoked. I was suddenly a contributor to the previously untouchable monolith of public knowledge, beauty and idiocy that is the internet.</p><p>Avery was a fan! Much as I felt when this site went live, it&rsquo;s generally pretty cool to have a public URI that points out your existence. Anyone can see it anywhere from any connected device. For me, this also brings a healthy level of discomfort.</p><h2 id=site-2-lettikittelcomhttpslettikittelcom>Site 2: <a href=https://lettikittel.com>lettikittel.com</a></h2><a class=img-link target=_blank href=/img/lettikittel.png><figure><img style=max-width:100% src=/img/lettikittel.png alt=lettikittel.png></figure></a><p>A similar gift exchange with the same group of friends rolled around this year, this time for Valentine&rsquo;s Day - a &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; gift exchange. I decided to step up my website gifting game with some basic interactivity. What&rsquo;s a sexier gift than a static website with some basic javascript?</p><p>Since the days of averyrobins.com, I had taken a few courses on <a href=https://scrimba.com/>scrimba.com</a> and learned how to style up a mostly-responsive site by building this one you&rsquo;re on now. My site is currently hosted through <a href=https://pages.github.com/>Github Pages</a> connected to a namecheap domain. I realized I could save the $1/month AWS fee (and a bunch of setup time) by creating a github account for Letti and doing the same thing there for her site.</p><p>Since the setup was so quick, I was actually able to focus on the styling and content of the site a lot more. It was fun to mess around with something that ended up pretty much looking like a customized MySpace page.</p><h2 id=site-3-katerinejimenezcomhttpskaterinejimenezcom>Site 3: <a href=https://katerinejimenez.com>katerinejimenez.com</a></h2><a class=img-link target=_blank href=/img/katjimenez.png><figure><img style=max-width:100% src=/img/katjimenez.png alt=katjimenez.png></figure></a><p>Kat was hosting her blog on wix.com, and without paying the annual fee, the wixsite.com subdomain was displayed in the URI. How could anyone take the content seriously with such a subdomain!? It was absolutely necessary for me to invest hours into porting the content to an entirely new platform.</p><p>I made Kat buy the domain name on namecheap and gave her a list of Jekyll themes. She picked one she liked and I emulated the layout and style, again hosting it on Github Pages. I think it looks quite nice.</p><p>In conclusion, websites can make a great gift for any occasion. These little projects taught me a lot about how the web works&ndash;I started from quite an unknowledgeable place&ndash;and I enjoyed making them a lot!</p></div></div></div><footer><div class=nav><a href=/ target=_self>home</a></div><div class=woopsy>measure twice, cut once</div></footer></body></html>
