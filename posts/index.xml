Your new machinemate, a Machinist who has been stationed here for a long time and designed and constructed much of the Machine themselves, brings you towards it.
The Machine mostly looks like the others you&amp;rsquo;ve worked on: a large wall, full of buttons and dials and knobs and readouts and flashing indicators. This one must be five stories tall. There&amp;rsquo;s about a sports field&amp;rsquo;s worth of it to your left and right, and no guessing its depth.</description></item><item><title>pdf-ify a website</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/pdf-ify-a-website/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/pdf-ify-a-website/</guid><description>I love writing a bit of code at the airport gate. My flight today had a 45 minute delay, so I was able to slap together a solution to a small problem I had.
I recently got a reMarkable 2 and love it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading through SICP on it, and really enjoy inserting note pages inline to do the exercises while I read the text.
I want to reference solutions for SICP problems to check my own answers and for when I get stuck.</description></item><item><title>a visit to Bletchley Park</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/a-visit-to-bletchley-park/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/a-visit-to-bletchley-park/</guid><description>I cannot imagine how, with our primitive methods of collecting and registering traffic, and our tiny staff for decoding it, we managed to cope at all. The main sensation of the newcomer was that he was participating in a miracle which he was entirely incapable of comprehending.

I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a few different ergonomic keyboards to see if any of them help, and they definitely have! Some reviews in brief:
ZSA Moonlander: ortholinear layout, split halves, tentable, palm rests, but still did not feel very ergo to me. Felt like I was often stretching my hands quite a bit and the thumb cluster felt uncomfortably spaced. I enjoyed customizing it, but the keyboard itself wasn&amp;rsquo;t friendly for my hands.</description></item><item><title>a simple hash table in C</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/hashmap-in-c/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/hashmap-in-c/</guid><description>I implemented a simple hash table in C when solving a problem in CS Primer. Solving it helped me gain better intuition around hash functions, pointers, and memory segments like the stack and the heap.
Basics You have probably encountered a hash table in the wild, like a dict in Python, map in Go, or Map in JavaScript. Hash tables associate a key with a value. Setting, looking up, and deleting values is average O(1) time complexity &amp;ndash; fast.</description></item><item><title>how to only torrent through a vpn</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/torrent-through-vpn/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/torrent-through-vpn/</guid><description>How can you make sure that you never accidentally have your torrent client on but your VPN off? You can restrict the network interface that your torrent client uses to that of your VPN.
To ensure privacy while torrenting legal content, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard the endless ads on podcasts and Youtube for using a VPN. This article assumes you already have a VPN and know how to turn it on and off.</description></item><item><title>the linux upskill challenge</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/linux-upskill/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/linux-upskill/</guid><description>The Linux Upskill Challenge is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been following on Reddit for a while and have been wanting to do. At this point, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty OK with computers, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to (re)learn some fundamentals of Linux and Unix systems.
This post contains my notes as I underwent the process.
Day 0: Setup Link
They recommend provisioning a VPC somewhere in the cloud. I chose AWS - signed up a for a new account on the free tier and created a t2.</description></item><item><title>reflecting on advent of code 2022</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/aoc-2022/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/aoc-2022/</guid><description>WARNING: as per title, here be spoilers for Advent of Code 2022.
Advent of Code (AoC) is a set of puzzles released daily from Dec 1st through Dec 25th each year. Each puzzle has two parts, with the prize of a &amp;ldquo;star&amp;rdquo; for each part completed. Puzzles are solved with a computer program of your own creation.
My overall experience with AoC 2022 was better than it was last year. I had less needless stress and gained more practice, insight, and knowledge from each puzzle.</description></item><item><title>please, may i see my knee?</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/please-may-i-see-my-knee/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/please-may-i-see-my-knee/</guid><description>TL;DR it can be hard to obtain, view, and share medical images of your own body.

Sometimes one might use Iterable as a type annotation to try to indicate something might be a set, a list, or a tuple.
But Iterable really just means something that implements __iter__().
And str implements __iter__(), e.g.:
for char in &amp;#34;abc&amp;#34;: print(char) # a # b # c And &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo; is a str, just like &amp;ldquo;abc&amp;rdquo; is a str.
So this type checks: my_var: Iterable[str] = &amp;quot;abc&amp;quot; (!</description></item><item><title>migrating kafka to amazon msk</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/migrating-to-msk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/migrating-to-msk/</guid><description>I work on the software team at Voltus. We orchestrate distributed energy resources-large-scale electricity users, residential consumers, batteries, and generators-to make the electric grid more resilient and pay our customers well.
This is the story of migrating one hundred microservices from self-managed Kafka in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) to Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK).
Initial State Kafka was introduced to the Voltus tech stack in 2019 and quickly became a critical piece of infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>setting up tidal cycles</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/tidal-cycles-setup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/tidal-cycles-setup/</guid><description>Tidal Cycles is software that works on top of another piece of software called SuperCollider.
Together, you can use them to produce music using code.
Today I set up these tools and made my first sound with them. Setup was a bit tricky, and this post is as much for myself to document what I did as it is for others pursuing their own setup in the future.
The first step is to install SuperCollider, following the install links for your platform at supercollider.</description></item><item><title>cron: for your health</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/cron-for-your-health/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/cron-for-your-health/</guid><description>I have a standing desk, but rarely stand. I have probably been sitting about 7 hours a day, which is too much! In the spirit of positive nudges for habit building and taking ownership over my notifications, I wrote a simple cron job to remind me to stand up every hour.

You can run it with node installed or in a docker container.
I like having a Typescript-ready environment without having to spinup a new react app or something. CodeSandbox was nice, but got pretty laggy at times and was hard to version control. Gluing together some tooling to scratch my own itch was fun.</description></item><item><title>rodney mullen and mastery</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/rodney-mullen-and-mastery/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 14:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/rodney-mullen-and-mastery/</guid><description>Today, I fell asleep on the couch watching youtube and woke up halfway through a Rodney Mullen documentary.
Rodney Mullen, like Simone Biles in gymnastics or Derren Brown in magic, is one of the best that will ever be in their domain. World champ at 14, inventor of the ollie and kickflip, a laundry list of other accolades&amp;hellip;there&amp;rsquo;s not much to dispute.
The podium finishers at the olympics this year in Skateboarding, while insanely skilled, won their medals doing stuff that doesn&amp;rsquo;t look much different than what Mullen was doing in the 80&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item><item><title>verbify your arrows</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/verbify-your-arrows/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2021 22:36:07 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/verbify-your-arrows/</guid><description>This is a diagram from an open source project I was evaluating at work recently, and the subsequent conversations I had:

Everyday from Dec 1st through 25th, a problem is released. Each problem requires some programming to solve, and is split into two separate but related parts.

Talking about money in general can be uncomfortable, and talking about giving money can just come off as self-congratulatory.

About 6 weeks ago, I launched colorcontroversy.com. Since then, the site has collected over 800,000 color judgements and been shared around the web more than I expected.
A much-simplified version of Randal Monroe of XKCD&amp;rsquo;s color survey, the site shows you a color shade and presents two color choices for that shade. For example, it shows you a dark turquoise and asks you if it&amp;rsquo;s Green or Blue.</description></item><item><title>covid projects</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/covid-projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/covid-projects/</guid><description>I have been very fortunate to remain employed during this global pandemic. My productivity working from home has been about on par with what I had in the office, although my learning rate has gone down a bit due to the lack of water-cooler style chats about the product and software in general.

Givewell is one of the most admirable philanthropic organizations out there. They recognize and act upon a number of important truths:
Money is a super powerful tool for reducing harm in the world Money can be used in more and less effective ways The effectiveness of money can be modeled with finite (possibly wide) uncertainty bounds at a non-trivial confidence level Encouraging those with the means to donate money to effective causes is important and worthwhile Moral judgement is an inseparable part of judging the effectiveness of an outcome Not only does Givewell maintain an active blog, a Giving 101 section of its site, run free events in the Bay Area every few months and deliver well-curated email updates, but they keep updated copies of their Cost Effectiveness Models and Guide to Cost Effective Analysis available online for everyone to view.</description></item><item><title>concurrency in python</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/concurrency-in-python/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/concurrency-in-python/</guid><description>Concurrency ! easy is Concurrency is of paramount importance in modern computing. It is a complex domain in itself, with major contributions from database development, machine learning, distributed application deployment, and academia.
Python requires a clear and simple concurrency framework as it is commonly used in high-compute settings like training neural networks. Matrix algebra has been made fast with NumPy and related tools, interfacing with C to get large performance improvements.</description></item><item><title>statistical bias</title><link>https://theleo.zone/posts/statistical-bias/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theleo.zone/posts/statistical-bias/</guid><description>Eat my spheres! You find yourself trapped in a room with Jigsaw, the villain from the Saw movies. There is a wood box of 100 spheres, some of them steel ball bearings and some of them gumballs.
