Shimon has a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/shimon_schocken_the_self_organizing_computer_course?language=pt">fantastic Ted Talk about the course</a> and many Recursers have done it in the past. I&rsquo;m 2 projects in to the first half of the course (<a href=https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome>Coursera link</a>)</p><p>The premise is that you start with a <code>Nand</code> (&ldquo;Not And&rdquo;) logic gate. The first project, you build other elementary logic gates from the <code>Nand</code> gate (e.g. <code>Not(x) = x Nand x</code>, furthermore <code>x And y = Not(x Nand y)</code>; etc.) The 12th and last project, you complete the operating system that you have built up from the <code>Nand</code> gate, with the 10 projects in between filling in all the gaps. You could build tetris (or any similar game) in the completed computer you have built &ldquo;from scratch&rdquo;.</p><a class=img-link target=_blank href=/img/nand2tetris_overview.png><figure><img style=max-width:95% src=/img/nand2tetris_overview.png alt=nand2tetris_overview.png><figcaption class=figcaption-text>The Nand2Tetris Overview</figcaption></figure></a><p>I am excited to keep digging in to the course. At 1 project per week, I&rsquo;ll complete the course just in time! I&rsquo;ve heard the last 6 projects are more time intensive than the first 6, so I&rsquo;m trying to budget time accordingly.</p><p>The other thing I&rsquo;ve been sinking time into is a prototype herd immunity simulation in python. <a href=https://github.com/haack>Alex Haak</a> and I are both excited about interactive data visualization and illustrating concepts through interactive online experiences. Our ultimate goal is to publish something on <a href=https://explorabl.es/>explorabl.es - Explorable Explanations</a>. This site is mind blowing. Don&rsquo;t visit it if you don&rsquo;t have a couple hours to kill.</p><p>Initial results for the simulator are really interesting! I came up with a simplified set of rules that give a certain level of complexity while still massively simplifying the real world. <a href=https://github.com/robinovitch61/herd_immunity>All the code is here.</a></p><a class=img-link target=_blank href=/img/good_immunity.gif><figure><img style=max-width:95% src=/img/good_immunity.gif alt=good_immunity.gif><figcaption class=figcaption-text>90% Immunity - Blue Immunity Protec</figcaption></figure></a><a class=img-link target=_blank href=/img/bad_immunity.gif><figure><img style=max-width:95% src=/img/bad_immunity.gif alt=bad_immunity.gif><figcaption class=figcaption-text>80% Immunity - Red Sickness Attac</figcaption></figure></a><p>Alex and I will be working on porting a modified version of this logic in to an awesome interactive data visualization - Alex is great with React, javascript, html, css, and general design so I&rsquo;m excited to learn a lot from him!</p><p>A mostly complete set of rules for the model:</p><ol><li><p>Number of agents is <code>GRID_WIDTH * GRID_HEIGHT = NUM_AGENTS</code>.
Each point in the rectangular grid is occupied by an agent.</p></li><li><p>Agents are randomly assigned an <code>IMMUNE</code> status, either 0
(susceptible) or 1 (immune), at the beginning.
<code>NUM_IMMUNE_START = PERC_IMMUNE_START * NUM_AGENTS</code></p></li><li><p>Agents are initially randomly flagged as sick, with
<code>NUM_SICK_START = PERC_SICK_START * NUM_AGENTS.</code> Immune agents
cannot be initially flagged as sick.</p></li><li><p>All agents that aren&rsquo;t immune or sick are set as initially healthy.</p></li><li><p>At each timestep, agents connect with some of the agents around them,
with probability of connecting to each agent within their
<code>CONNECTION_DISTANCE</code> being <code>PROB_SOCIAL</code> . This
determines the candidate pool a given agent could connect with:</p></li></ol><ul><li>If <code>CONNECTION_DISTANCE = 1</code>, agents have a candidate pool of &lt;= 8, that is, the agents directly around them in a square with themself at the center.</li><li>If <code>CONNECTION_DISTANCE = 2,</code> agents have a candidate pool of &lt;= 16, that is, the agents directly around them in 2 concentric squares with themself at the center.</li><li>etc. with <code>CONNECTION_DISTANCE &lt;= MAX(GRID_WIDTH, GRID_HEIGHT) - 1</code></li></ul><ol start=6><li><p>If a sick agent connects with a healthy agent who is not immune,
probability of infection is <code>PROB_INFECTION.</code> If a sick agent
connects with an immune agent, probability of infection is zero (could
change later accounting for imperfect vaccination success rate).</p></li><li><p>After infections occur, each agent has a chance to recover with
<code>PROB_RECOVERY</code>. Sick agents then have a chance to die with
<code>PROB_DEATH</code>.</p></li></ol><p>Recurse continues to be a fantastic experience, albeit a little overwhelming in the sheer volume of knowledge and opportunities it presents! This is a great problem to have. I am trying to stay focused on diving in to items of greatest interest while not burning myself out before the 12 weeks are up. It&rsquo;s also FLYING by.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
