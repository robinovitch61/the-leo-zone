Interviews went well and I had a nice time seeing some friends while there.</p><p>Unfortunately, there wasn&rsquo;t enough time to finish the compiler of nand2tetris! The first week where I haven&rsquo;t finished my nand2tetris project :&rsquo;(. I&rsquo;m going to try my best to finish up both the compiler and OS this final week, though!</p><p>I was also focusing on finishing a take-home assignment from another interview process which definitely cut in to my time. As annoying and time consuming it is to generate contrived work to prove you&rsquo;re not lying on your resume, it was sort of fun to develop an application with a relational database and interactive web UI and make it feel smooth and look pretty. Link to the project is <a href=https://github.com/robinovitch61/impossible_app>here on github</a>.</p><p>RC is ending so soon! I&rsquo;m so mixed up about it. 12 weeks flies by, truly. Seeing everyone&rsquo;s demos last week reminded me of how awesome everyone is here and how many cool projects come out of this space. I&rsquo;ve been so fortunate to be a part of it, and I want to squeeze all I can out of my last week here.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
