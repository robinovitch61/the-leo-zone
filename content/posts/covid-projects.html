  I have been very fortunate to remain employed during this global pandemic. My
  productivity working from home has been about on par with what I had in the
  office, although my learning rate has gone down a bit due to the lack of
  water-cooler style chats about the product and software in general. We use
  Slack for remote chat and it feels a bit too formal to trigger notifications
  for offhand questions.
</p>

<p>
  My free time has been sometimes well-spent, sometimes less so. One of the
  efforts I'm proud of is
  <a href="https://covid19medstudents.ca/">covid19medstudents.ca</a>. In the
  spirit of <a href="/2020/03/08/gifting-websites.html">gifting websites</a> and
  leveraging tech to help the COVID relief effort in some way, I collaborated
  with a good friend from home to make this site. My friend is president of his
  medical student's society, and along with a talented designer on his team (<a

  we created an online index of volunteer opportunities and resources aimed at
  medical students and physicians in Western Canada. It has connected physicians
  and med students to ~50 projects across 3 provinces over the last couple
  months.

  It was a satisfying effort. I was feeling quite useless during the early
  stages of the pandemic, being neither essential nor truly negatively effected.
  I enjoyed working with a friendly client to fulfill a vision, working with a
  skilled designer to make things look great, and hearing about volunteers
  getting connected to projects through the site.

  I've also had the chance to be a Section Leader for Stanford's online "Code In
  Place" class. The instructors of CS106A, a relatively well-known intro to
  programming course offered by Stanford, decided to run a remote "first half of
  the course" over 6 weeks of instruction during COVID. Over 5 of those weeks, I
  met up with ~8 students via zoom as a teaching assistant and we worked through
  Python challenges together. Participants were brand new to programming and
  from a huge variety of backgrounds. Seeing them grow and progress over the 5
  weeks from learning what a variable was to writing their own text parsers was
  so very cool.

<p>
  Another fun project has been taking on the semi-famous
  <a href="https://cryptopals.com/">cryptopals cryptography challenges</a>. Many
  sharp folks at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> were
  working on these during my time there and I had heard it was a good way to
  learn a new programming language. I'm
  <a href="https://github.com/robinovitch61/cryptopals/tree/master/src"
    >solving them in Scala</a
  >
  as that's the primary language used at my work, and I've also taken the
  opportunity to encorporate a test driven development approach to the
  challenges. My tests vary in quality, from
  <code>"frequencyScore" should "be smaller for more englishey things"</code> to
  <code>"encodeToHexWithXorVigenere" should "encode correctly"</code>.
</p>

<p>
  I've absolutely loved the format of the challenges - clear and seemingly
  "simple enough" questions with very little theoretical explanations, leaving
  the solver to do the digging and self-education required to make sense of
  things. For instance, in set 1, question 6, they walk you through a method of
  finding first the key length, then the key itself for a ciphertext encoded
  using a repeated-key XOR cipher. Things they don't tell you outright:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Given a collection of characters, estimating a probability that the
    characters were sampled from English or from random garbage text is both a
    science and an art. They recommend frequency scoring, and my final
    <code>frequencyScore</code> function included character frequency
    comparisons to the English language as well as checks for
    <code>allCharsInAsciiRange</code> and
    <code>hasReasonableNumSpecialChars</code>. I also experimented with number
    of spaces in the text sample, to less than excellent results. It felt like
    getting a good model for this was half the challenge.
  </li>
  <li>
    The challenge talks about computing and maybe averaging the hamming distance
    of ciphertext snippets to get the key length. The hamming distance is the
    number of differing bits. Three equal-length strings, A, B, and K, have the
    same number of bits. The XOR operation is 1 only if the bits are different,
    so you can get the hamming distance by counting the number of ones after
    XOR'ing two strings. Note that num_1_bits(A XOR K XOR B XOR K) =
    num_1_bits(A XOR B). Also, since English has non-uniform character
    frequency, the hamming distance of two english snippets is lower than that
    of two garbage snippets, as english is more similar to english than random
    text is to random text. All of this was very non-obvious to me and required
    reading and experimenting a decent amount! Averaging the hamming distance
    was also definitely necessary to get good results across other encoded text
    with different keys.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cracking repeating-key XOR is relatively probabilistic. The longer the
    ciphertext in relation to the key, the better shot at decoding you've got!
    It was easy for me to spend too much time optimizing for instantly cracking
    all future possible key/text combos - I had to say enough was enough and
    move on at some point.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here is some code I cracked:</p>
<code

<p>:)</p>

<p>
  I've also been playing a good amount of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Rocket
  League, and Super Smash Bros. Finally, I'm now a plant Dad.
