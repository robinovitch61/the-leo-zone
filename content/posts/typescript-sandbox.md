I made a simple live-reloading Typescript sandbox, similar to the [Vanilla Typescript CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/vanilla-typescript-vanilla-ts)
but running locally.

You can run it with `node` installed or in a docker container.

I like having a Typescript-ready environment without having to spinup a new react app or something. CodeSandbox was nice, but got pretty laggy at times
and was hard to version control. Gluing together some tooling to scratch my own itch was fun.
