What motivates one to learn?

Insecurity and fear - the bone-deep worry of being called on in a public setting and not knowing the answer.

Childlike wonderment. Following your curiosity.

You have to be kind of dumb to learn new things.

If you're too smart, the following thoughts might get in your way:

* what if I'm too slow/old/impatient/busy to learn this new thing?
* I already know many important things. If \[new thing\] were important, I would already know it
* I've heard other smart people say that \[new thing\] is hard. Why would I be able to learn it?
* even if I learn \[new thing\], there will still be many more knowledgeable than me on the subject, so what's the
  point?

To learn, you need a suspended disbelief about your own limitations, internal and external.

You also need a child-like sense of curiosity and willingness to follow the next thread without letting the fear that
your inability to reach the end of thread means something about your intrinsic intelligence or value.

You need to be open to having fundamental assumptions about your preconceptions challenged.

Second order thoughts about "what this all means about you" should be minimized.

The traits embodied to effectively learn are playfulness, wonder, and a low-ego open mindedness.
