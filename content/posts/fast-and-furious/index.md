# The Fast and the Furious (2001)

A great movie. You can see why it spawned 9 sequels.

Best action:

- The first race. NOS is like jet fuel, the world goes by in streaks.

Most heartwarming moment:

- When Brian helps save Vince from the trucker with a shotgun despite their past differences

Biggest surprise:

- The fast and the furious franchise is Point Break with cars instead of surfing

# 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)

A less great movie. Vin Diesel apparently thought the script sucked and chose to do The Chronicles of Riddick instead.

Best action sequences:

- The game of chicken Brian plays to win the American Muscle cars in the double pink slip race
- Jumping a car from a road onto a yacht

Most heartwarming moment:

- When Brian and Roman reminisce about growing up together, "playing football in the dirt" and all the other "stupid
  things they did"

Biggest Surprises:

- Tej (Ludacris) gets a Royal Flush (1 in 649,740 odds) in the one hand of poker we see them play
- The introduction of electric grappling guns that disable cars when engaged

# Tokyo Drift

TODO

Best action sequences:

- The drift through the huge crowd of people
- Drift race down the mountain was insane

Most heartwarming moment:

- Lil BowWow's character's name is Twinkie

Biggest Surprises:
