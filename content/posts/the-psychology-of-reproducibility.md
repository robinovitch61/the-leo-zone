* I hate losing things - losing blankey before moving to Canada
* Effort put in to make things reproducible vs the value of the thing itself
* Not important: one off analysis, simple scripts, security/privacy, no need for auditability
* Important: large apps with CI/CD, auditable requirements (insurance, law, etc.), repeatable pipelines, models
* Experimenting in the kitchen with a new recipe - do you take down everything you did and put in and how you did it, or do you just make the thing and hope an intuition for repeatibility develops over time?
