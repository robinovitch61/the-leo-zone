* spartans (greeks?) shave head, write message on head, let it grow, travel, shave again to read
* mary queen of scots and the babington plot not having a strong enough cipher, getting beheaded
* the beale ciphers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beale_ciphers
* zimmermann telegram in ww2 and the GENIUS of the brits in concealing that they cracked it
    * wait until it reaches mexico, steal the version from there using a secret agent, and leak that version in the
      american press
    * to strengthen the cover story, they encouraged criticism of their own british code breakers in the british media,
      in order to convince the germans that no, really, they were doing a very bad job
* cat and mouse between cryptographers and cryptanalysts
    * monoalphabetic substitution cipher, broken by frequency analysis first by the arabs then the europeans hundreds of
      years later
    * book cipher (second beale cipher)
    * viginere cipher, broken by babbage and kasiski
    * the one-time pad, unbreakable, but inconvenient
* TODO: check out implementations of enigma online
* the weaknesses of the enigma were human
    * repeating message keys
    * cillies (e.g. the initials of your loved one)
    * restrictions on plugboard settings or scrambler arrangements
    * structured messages resulting in cribs - needed a crib for Turing's bombes to work
* depictions of Turing may have been very inaccurate in the imitation game
    * not an asshole (?)
    * worked there from the start, didn't just swoop in with an idea for the bombe
    * first bombe didn't work fast enough, but a redesign was completed very quickly and most of the time was waiting on
      manufacturing
    * didn't marry a woman for cover at Bletchley (?)
* Japanese Purple cipher - TODO: look in to this
* American SIGABA cipher and british Typex cipher - TODO: look in to these
* Using Navaho or another rare language as the cipher text
