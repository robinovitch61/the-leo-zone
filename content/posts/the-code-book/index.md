* spartans (greeks?) shave head, write message on head, let it grow, travel, shave again to read
* mary queen of scots and the babington plot not having a strong enough cipher, getting beheaded
* the beale ciphers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beale_ciphers
* zimmermann telegram in ww2 and the GENIUS of the brits in concealing that they cracked it
    * wait until it reaches mexico, steal the version from there using a secret agent, and leak that version in the
      american press
    * to strengthen the cover story, they encouraged criticism of their own british code breakers in the british media,
      in order to convince the germans that no, really, they were doing a very bad job
* cat and mouse between cryptographers and cryptanalysts
    * monoalphabetic substitution cipher, broken by frequency analysis first by the arabs then the europeans hundreds of
      years later
    * book cipher (second beale cipher)
    * viginere cipher, broken by babbage and kasiski
    * the one-time pad, unbreakable, but inconvenient
