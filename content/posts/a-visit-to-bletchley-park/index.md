One of my highest priority trips while living in London this year was visiting [Bletchley Park][bletchley]. I'd seen
[The Imitation Game][imitationgame] and knew a few things about [Alan Turing][turing] within the context of the history
of computing, so I had a strong sense that Bletchley Park would be a special place to visit in real life.

Bletchley Park was home base for the Allied code breaking operation during World War II. According to Historian [Harry
Hinsley][hinsley], the intel out of Bletchley "shortened the war by not less that two years and probably by four years"
([source][shortened]). At peak, it employed almost 9000 people - Mathematicians, Linguists, Cryptographers, Typists,
Historians, Translators, Cooks, Dispatch Riders (motorcyclists who carried classified intel between locations),
Librarians, Musicians, and many others. Almost three-quarters of them were [women]. Most of the original physical
documents and machines were destroyed and information about it remained classified after the war. It wasn't until the
'70s that the world started to know the full nature of the work that was done there from 1938 to 1946. Work on some
ciphers wasn't declassified until the 21st century!

It reopened as a museum in '93, with the original mansion and huts where the codebreakers did most of their work intact
and recreations of many other artifacts. The museum is lovely, with many interactive elements, informative tours, and a
very high volume of content. Five hours in a single day wasn't enough to explore it fully. I'll share some of my photos
and main recollections, but you should definitely go at least once if you have the chance!

[Y-stations][ystations] intercepted 3,000 to 20,000 messages daily from radio traffic which, if encrypted, were then
hand-delivered or [teleprinted] to Bletchley Park. Then came the task of deciphering the encrypted messages, which is
what so much of the literature of Bletchley Park focuses on. Once that day's cipher settings were worked out for a given
machine (e.g. [Enigma], [Lorenz], and [Purple]), the mechanical task of deciphering all of the messages with modified
[Typex] machines was completed. Then came translation (e.g. German to English), cross-referencing, and sending out the
intel -- code named "Ultra" -- to relevant strategic parties. Ultra couldn't be used unless there was a viable cover
story for how they had obtained the intel, as it was vital to keep the Axis powers believing that their ciphers remained
unbroken.

At Bletchley, the main mansion and breakout huts were busy with folks carrying out these tasks. Some of the rooms of the
mansion were reserved for leisure and activities, like the Ballroom, Tennis Courts and the Drama club, that put on more
than 20 performances through the years.

The people were extremely diverse, ranging from unkempt nerds to military command. [Tolkein] was on the list of
emergency recruits for Bletchley, but declined. Hierarchy and bureaucracy emerged as the years went on, but there was a
remarkably flat and self-directed structure for most of the years of Bletchley Park's operation.

Years before folks at Bletchley started working to crack Enigma, three Polish mathematician-cryptologists had made
significant progress. [Marian Rejewsky][rejewsky], [Jerzy Różycki][jerzy], and [Henryk Zygalski][zygalski], working for
the [Polish Cipher Bureau][polishbureau], reconstructed the Enigma machine from limited French military intelligence. In
1939, they met the French and British at a conference in Warsaw and shared their intel, including copies of the
reconstructed Enigma machine. Rejewsky also invented the [bomba kryptologiczna][bomba] in order to speed up the
decipherment process. There is a great memorial to these men at Bletchley Park these days.

[Alan Turing][turing] and [Gordon Welchman][welchman] improved on the design of the Poles to adapt to further design and
operational changes of the Enigma machine. Using the fact that Enigma never enciphered a character as itself and that
parts of the cipher text could be guessed ("cribs"), they designed huge mechanized [Bombe] machines that were then built
by the [British Tabulating Machine Company][btmc]. Starting in 1940, Bombes began breaking messages regularly, and more
and more machines were manufactured and spread around to outstations in order to avoid losing all of them at once in an
air raid. The Bombes were configured and operated by Wrens according to a [menu]s, which tested a crib against a piece
of ciphertext in order to determine the machine settings that produced that text.

Work at Bletchley also lead to the world's first programmable computer: [Colossus]. It used vacuum tubes to perform
basic operations, and was optimized for decrypting messages out of the next generation [Lorenz] machine. [Tommy
Flowers][flowers] designed and lead its prototyping. It played a critical role in gathering intelligence prior to
[D-Day][dday], and remained secret until the mid-'70s.
