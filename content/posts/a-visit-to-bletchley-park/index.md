One of my highest priority trips while living in London this year was visiting Bletchley Park. I'd seen [The Imitation
Game][imitationgame] and of course knew a few things about [Alan Turing][turing] within the context of the history of
computing, but still had a strong sense that [Bletchley Park][bletchley] would be a very special place to visit. I was
not wrong.

Bletchley Park was home base for the Allied code breaking operation during World War II. According to Historian [Harry
Hinsley][hinsley], the intel out of Bletchley "shortened the war by not less that two years and probably by four years"
([source][shortened]).

- y stations
- ending the war 2-4yrs faster
- steps
  - intercept
  - work out encryption scheme
  - decipher
  - translate
  - cross reference
  - send out intel
- not being able to act on every piece of intel (dramatacized brother scene in film)
- enigma and lorenz
  - enigma never encrypted letter as itself
- typex machines for encryption + decryption
- employee growth explosion (200 to 9000+)
- took decades before recognition
- turing exhibit pathetic ending
- polish cryptographers pre-work
- variety of people employed there (mathematicians, linguists, "classicists", translators, typists, cooks, dispatch
  riders, librarians, etc)
- the complex process of communicating decyphered messages with one time pads/typex (ULTRA)
- japanese purple machine
- machines
  - Polish Bomba
  - Turing-Welchman Bombe (complex UI/"menu")
  - Colossus (Fish, Lorenz, Tommy Flowers, before ENIAC)
