  <p>
    I first met Leo in southern South Sudan while I was on safari. Our vehicle
    neared one of the last Northern White Rhino's in the world...
  </p>

  <p>
    A human figure squatted near the massive rhino, stroking its head to
    comfort it with one hand and holding a huge viper in the other. Sending
    the rhino on its way, he spit out the venom he had sucked out of the
    rhino's leg. Bending down to safely release the snake, Leo looked up at
    us, smiling and waving.
  </p>

  <p>
    I later learned that Leo was halfway through his monthly 200-mile barefoot
    run across the grassland when he stopped to help the rhino, still
    finishing the run with a personal best time. He was able to continue
    volunteer work on the locally-run medical center that afternoon.

    While only some (or none) of this may be true, I would still heartily
    recommend this fine young man to anyone looking for help on important and
    interesting problems."
