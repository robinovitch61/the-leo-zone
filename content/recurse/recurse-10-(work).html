  My second to last week at RC was first spent in San Francisco at onsite
  interviews for positions in the city. Interviews went well and I had a nice
  time seeing some friends while there.

<p>
  Unfortunately, there wasn't enough time to finish the compiler of nand2tetris!
  The first week where I haven't finished my nand2tetris project :'(. I'm going
  to try my best to finish up both the compiler and OS this final week, though!
</p>

<p>
  I was also focusing on finishing a take-home assignment from another interview
  process which definitely cut in to my time. As annoying and time consuming it
  is to generate contrived work to prove you're not lying on your resume, it was
  sort of fun to develop an application with a relational database and
  interactive web UI and make it feel smooth and look pretty. Link to the
  project is
  <a href="https://github.com/robinovitch61/impossible_app">here on my github</a
  >.

  RC is ending so soon! I'm so mixed up about it. 12 weeks flies by, truly.
  Seeing everyone's demos last week reminded me of how awesome everyone is here
  and how many cool projects come out of this space. I've been so fortunate to
  be a part of it, and I want to squeeze all I can out of my last week here.
