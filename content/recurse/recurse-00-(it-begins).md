It is day 3 at the Recurse Center (RC)!

{{< fig src="me-rust-haskell.gif" caption="Me experimenting with Haskell and Rust" >}}

It has been a whirlwind of orientation, meeting awesome people, learning about (and about the existence of) new cool things, setting up and settling in.

This was my second day here:
* *8-9am*: Research blogging tools to create this very website. Decide on Jekyll + github pages + namecheap domain as a good solution
* *9-10am*: Update MacOS to Mojave after experiencing ruby-related jekyll issues
* *10-11am*: Using [this great tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/), get `jekyll` and `bundler` installed. Get `jekyll serve` working and start developing this blog
* *11-12pm*: Pair programming workshop! Create a version of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in python. [Gist here](https://gist.github.com/robinovitch61/8a094c15f8cc28ec9218a1baf6b211c6#file-game_of_life-py).
* *12-12:15pm*: Discuss wind speed measurements using an arduino with someone working on an auto-steering sailboat. Yay mech eng knowledge!
* *12:15-1pm*: Lunch chat with someone, discuss what Rust is and why people are excited about it (memory and type safety)
* *1-2pm*: Participated in an "Intro to Haskell" workshop. No loops, variables don't vary, unclear code execution order...what is this language??
* *2-3pm*: Continue site development
* *3-4pm*: Category theory discussion group. First foray into theoretical math in a long time. Approachable intro by the few folks with deeper knowledge on the topic.
* *4-5:30pm*: Further introductory Haskell chat, help solidify some core concepts intro'd earlier
* *5:30-6:30pm*: Non-technical presentations (7 mins max) - folks did them on cross stitching, rube goldberg machine demo, cats, contact juggling, architecture, and the origin of the English language

It's everything I had hoped for and more.

The space is incredible, with tons of work stations, a large library, 5 or 6 functioning vintage PCs from the early days to play with, breakout rooms, an LED project you can control via your computer, a nap space, and clean and functional kitchen/lunch area.

My goals here are (in no particular order):
* Gain a stronger foundation in computer science theory (algorithms, data structures, complexity management, etc.)
* Continue to build on my statistics and probability knowledge, likely with some forays in to AI projects
* Learn of more "unknown unkowns" - concepts that I didn't know existed but are incredibly interesting and/or useful
* Reshape my assumptions about education and what the learning process looks like
* Become a much more effective programmer so I can kick ass at my next role

Some pitfalls I'd like to avoid:
* Have my time dominated by learning tools rather than understanding concepts and theory. Learning a tool (e.g. a new programming language, framework, library, etc.) can be done when it's time to implement conceptually complete visions
* Stretch myself too thin by trying to learn everything and then feeling like I'm not really learning anything
* Get sucked in by "the hype" around a language or domain without properly evaluating whether or not it is the best way to spend my time at my current stage of development
* Lose steam by pushing too hard, feeling like I'm not succeeding, or failing to achieve my incremental goals

I'm so excited! Pitter patter...
