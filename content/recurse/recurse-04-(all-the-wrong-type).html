  This week, the hack computer's hardware was completed with project 5 of
  Nand2Tetris! I decided to write the remaining software portion of the course
  (projects 6-12) in Rust, feeding two birds with one scone.

  While I started learning Rust with the
  <a href="http://downloads.codecoding.com/rust/Programming%20Rust.pdf"
    >the O'Reilly Book</a
  >, I've found
  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Programming Language</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings">Rustlings</a> to be great
  resources as well. It was also incredibly helpful when Evan installed Rust
  Language Server (RLS) in my VSCode environment, making it easy to view source
  code and highlighting errors before compile time. This had to have increased
  the learning rate 3x or so. Rust is incredibly strict in comparison to the
  dynamic programming that I'm used to. This quote sums it up and keeps me
  going:
</p>

<blockquote>
  I’ve found that Rust has forced me to learn many of the things that I was
  slowly learning as ‘good practice’ in C/C++ before I could even compile my
  code. ...I want to stress that Rust isn’t the kind of language you can learn
  in a couple days and just deal with the hard/technical/good-practice stuff
  later. You will be forced to learn strict safety immediately and it will
  probably feel uncomfortable at first. However in my own experience, this has
  led me towards feeling like compiling my code actually means something to me
  again.
  <p>—Mitchell Nordine</p>

<p>Rust will be the first language I program in that is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Statically typed (you must specify types unless they can be inferred)</li>
  <li>Compiled rather than interpreted</li>
  <li>
    Memory-explicit in a real way, with concepts of ownership, references, and
    mutability very explicit
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Despite banging my head against this new language in frustration and being
  disproportionately happy when anything works at all, I'm super psyched to
  stick with it and finish Nand2Tetris in Rust.
</p>

<p>
  I also finished a
  <a href="/2019/10/25/statistical-bias.html">blog post on statistical bias</a>.
  Going through these "rudimentary" ideas in detail like
  <a href="/2019/10/18/linear-regression-theory.html">linear regression</a> and
  bias has been incredibly satisfying. Even though they're fundamental ideas,
  going through the proofs in detail has been super informative - they very
  quickly get in to quite complex matrix calculus and linear algebra. It is more
  clear now why undergraduate engineering sort of skims over the proofs and
  gives you the final formulas...
</p>

<p>
  The job search continues to slowly creep in to my daily concerns. It will
  likely be a rollercoaster of hope, hard decisions, and rejection. I am
  prioritizing companies who have missions I can deeply align with first and
  foremost. Interview prep is on the horizon...
