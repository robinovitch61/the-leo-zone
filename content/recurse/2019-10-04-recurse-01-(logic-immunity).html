title: Recurse 01 (logic immunity)
---
<p>I have been learning about basic computer architecture (logic gates) and working on a herd immunity simulation.</p>

<p>Computer architecture work has come from the awesome <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">Nand2Tetris course</a> by Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan. Shimon has <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/shimon_schocken_the_self_organizing_computer_course?language=pt">a fantastic Ted Talk about the course</a> and many Recursers have done it in the past. I'm 2 projects in to the first half of the course (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome">Coursera link</a>)</p>

<p>The premise is that you start with a <code>Nand</code> ("Not And") logic gate. The first project, you build other elementary logic gates from the <code>Nand</code> gate (e.g. <code>Not(x) = x Nand x</code>, furthermore <code>x And y = Not(x Nand y)</code>; etc.) The 12th and last project, you complete the operating system that you have built up from the <code>Nand</code> gate, with the 10 projects in between filling in all the gaps. You could build tetris (or any similar game) in the completed computer you have built "from scratch".</p>

<p>I am excited to keep digging in to the course. At 1 project per week, I'll complete the course just in time! I've heard the last 6 projects are more time intensive than the first 6, so I'm trying to budget time accordingly.</p>

<p>The other thing I've been sinking time into is a prototype herd immunity simulation in python. <a href="https://github.com/haack">Alex Haak</a> and I are both excited about interactive data visualization and illustrating concepts through interactive online experiences. Our ultimate goal is to publish something on <a href="https://explorabl.es/">explorabl.es - Explorable Explanations</a>. This site is mind blowing. Don't visit it if you don't have a couple hours to kill.</p>

<p>Initial results for the simulator are really interesting! I came up with a simplified set of rules that give a certain level of complexity while still massively simplifying the real world. <a href="https://github.com/robinovitch61/herd_immunity">All the code is here.</a></p>

<p>Alex and I will be working on porting a modified version of this logic in to an awesome interactive data visualization - Alex is great with React, javascript, html, css, and general design so I'm excited to learn a lot from him!</p>

<p>A mostly complete set of rules for the model:</p>

<i>
<p>1. Number of agents is <code>GRID_WIDTH * GRID_HEIGHT = NUM_AGENTS</code>. Each point in the rectangular grid is occupied by an agent.</p>

<p>2. Agents are randomly assigned an <code>IMMUNE</code> status, either 0 (susceptible) or 1 (immune), at the beginning. <code>NUM_IMMUNE_START = PERC_IMMUNE_START * NUM_AGENTS</code></p>

<p>3. Agents are initially randomly flagged as sick, with <code>NUM_SICK_START = PERC_SICK_START * NUM_AGENTS.</code> Immune agents cannot be initially flagged as sick.</p>

<p>4. All agents that aren't immune or sick are set as initially healthy.</p>

<p>5. At each timestep, agents connect with some of the agents around them, with probability of connecting to each agent within their <code>CONNECTION_DISTANCE</code> being <code>PROB_SOCIAL</code> . This determines the candidate pool a given agent could connect with:</p>

<p class="indent">If <code>CONNECTION_DISTANCE = 1</code>, agents have a candidate pool of  <= 8, that is, the agents directly around them in a square with themself at the center.</p>

<p class="indent">If <code>CONNECTION_DISTANCE = 2,</code> agents have a candidate pool of <= 16, that is, the agents directly around them in 2 concentric squares with themself at the center.</p>

<p class="indent">etc. with <br><code>CONNECTION_DISTANCE <= MAX(GRID_WIDTH, GRID_HEIGHT) - 1</code></p>

<p>6. If a sick agent connects with a healthy agent who is not immune, probability of infection is <code>PROB_INFECTION.</code> If a sick agent connects with an immune agent, probability of infection is zero (could change later accounting for imperfect vaccination success rate).</p>

<p>7. After infections occur, each agent has a chance to recover with <code>PROB_RECOVERY</code>. Sick agents then have a chance to die with <code>PROB_DEATH</code>.</p>

<p>Recurse continues to be a fantastic experience, albeit a little overwhelming in the sheer volume of knowledge and opportunities it presents! This is a great problem to have. I am trying to stay focused on diving in to items of greatest interest while not burning myself out before the 12 weeks are up. It's also FLYING by.</p>
