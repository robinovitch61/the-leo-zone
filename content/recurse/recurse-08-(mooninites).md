This week, I completed Nand2Tetris project 9, [wrote about Givewell]({{< ref givewell-is-awesome >}}), and continued interview prep.

Nand2Tetris' gets you used to programming in the high-level "Jack" programming language. It would be difficult (or at least, less meaningful) to write a compiler for a high level language that you don't really understand.

I found it useful in that it solidified the rules of Jack and allowed me to project my thoughts of what the compiler would be doing to translate Jack code to VM Code.

The "game" I wrote was just enough to feel like I understood the syntax of the language, and isn't really a game at all. I did make a Mooninite from Aqua Teen Hunger Force fire rockets in to a guys mouth, though! No winning or losing criteria were defined but it sure was fun.
