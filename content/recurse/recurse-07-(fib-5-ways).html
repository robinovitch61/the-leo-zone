<p>Recurse continues!</p>

<p>
  Each successive number in the Fibonacci Sequence is the sum of the two prior
  numbers. The series starts with 1, 1:
</p>

<p id="fibonacci">0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...</p>

<p>
  While learning about algorithms and doing nand2tetris, I've come across the
  Fibonacci Sequence a number of times. Here are a 5 ways to calculate the Nth
  element of the sequence:
</p>

<h2>Method 1: Recursion</h2>
<p>
  Recursion is when a function calls itself. Intuitively, it's a top down
  approach to problem solving. Say Charlie is wondering what the fourth number
  in the Fibonacci Sequence is. She might say, well, the fourth number is the
  second number plus the third number. The second number is 1 as the sequence
  starts with 1, 1. The third number is the first number plus the second number,
  both of which are 1, so the third number is 1 + 1 = 2. So the fourth number is
  1 + 2 = 3!
</p>
<p>
  The idea is to drill down until you get to the base cases (here, the first and
  second numbers), and then traverse up your nested logic back to the original
  question. In a computer, each recursive call adds a new "frame" to the working
  stack, where a frame includes function arguments, local variables, and
  relevant pointers that allow restoration of the previous frame. More on this
  later.
</p>
<p>
  In python, recursively solving for the Nth Fibonacci Number looks as follows:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">## Recursive Fibbing
def recursive_fib(n):
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError('Fibonacci sequence starts at first number.')
    elif n <= 2:
        return n-1 # first = 0, second = 1
    else:
        return recursive_fib(n-2) + recursive_fib(n-1)

# Timing code included here for reference
from timeit import timeit
runs = 10000
time = timeit(
    "recursive_fib(10)",
    setup="from __main__ import recursive_fib",
    number=runs)
print("recursive_fib took average of {:.2E}s across {} runs"
    .format(time/runs, runs))
# >> recursive_fib took average of 1.82E-05s across 10000 runs

recursive_fib(10)
# >> 34
</code></pre>

<p>
  Note that this gets realllly slow as time goes on, and it isn't very space
  efficient either. Each progressive call to the function adds a frame to the
  call stack that uses up some memory. Additionally, repeat operations occur -
  note how Fib(3) shows up twice in the tree below.

</p>

<p>
  In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">Big-O notation</a>,
  this algorithm is O(~2^n) in time and O(n) in space, both not ideal.
</p>

<h2>Method 2: Dynamic Programming - Top Down</h2>
<p>
  This method, sometimes also called "Memoization", confusingly references
  "Dynamic Programming". Note that Dynamic Programming has nothing to do with
  the concept of a Dynamic Programming Language. Dynamic Programming is a method
  for solving complex problems by breaking them in to smaller sub problems and
  solving each of these problems once, storing the answer for possible reuse. A
  Dynamic Programming Language like Python or Javascript can execute code at
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_(program_lifecycle_phase)"
    >runtime</a
  >
  that would require compilation in a Static Programming Language.
</p>

<p>
  The simple improvement upon the purely recursive solution above is to save the
  results of each calculation. In doing so, recalculating prior results multiple
  times is avoided. The dictionary implementation in Python is a hashmap with
  constant time insertion and retrieval, so no time complexity is added by the
  use of a <code>dict</code> below:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">## Fibbing with Memoization
def memo_fib(n, memo=None):
    if memo is None:
        memo = {}
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError('Fibonacci sequence starts at first number.')
    elif n <= 2:
        return n-1 # first = 0, second = 1
    else:
        # check if already calculated result
        if n not in memo:
            # function calls itself twice w/ same memo
            memo[n] = memo_fib(n-2, memo) + memo_fib(n-1, memo)
        return memo[n]

# Similar timing code to above produces:
# >> memo_fib(10) took average of 5.04E-06s across 10000 runs

memo_fib(10)
# >> 34
</code></pre>

<p>
  As per the timing code, memoization produces a much faster calculation - other
  than the hashtable lookups, no duplicate computation is being done.
</p>

<p>
  The time complexity is now O(n), with space complexity still at O(n) as the
  call stack and memo <code>dict</code> both have O(n) space.
</p>

<h2>Method 3: Dynamic Programming - Bottom Up</h2>
<p>
  Another equivalent and sometimes more intuitive way to look at Dynamic
  Programming as a solution is to build a "table" of all the solutions to each
  little problem that must be solved along the way to solving the more
  complicated problem. This is sometimes called "Tabulation" In this case, the
  "table" could be a Python list that holds its <code>index+1</code>'th
  Fibonacci number, e.g. the 1st Fibonacci number is at <code>table[0]</code>,
  4th at <code>table[3]</code>, etc.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">## Fibbing with Tabulation
def table_fib(n):
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError('Fibonacci sequence starts at first number.')
    elif n <= 2:
        return n-1 # first = 0, second = 1
    else:
        table = [0, 1] + [None]*(n-2)
        for idx in range(2, len(table)):
            table[idx] = table[idx-2] + table[idx-1]
        return table[n-1]

# Similar timing code to above produces:
# >> table_fib(10) took average of 2.18E-06s across 10000 runs

table_fib(10)
# >> 34
</code></pre>

<p>
  As discussed in the excellent post
  <a
    href="https://programming.guide/dynamic-programming-vs-memoization-vs-tabulation.html"
    >here</a
  >, tabulation is best when each sub problem is to be solved only once, where
  memoization is best when not all subproblems have to be solved to get to the
  answer to the overarching question. Fibonacci is a case where all subproblems
  must be solved only once, so Tabulation is faster by a constant factor.
</p>

<p>Both Tabulation and Memoization are O(n) in time and O(n) in space.</p>

<h2>Method 4: Iteration</h2>
<p>
  Note that the tabulation method is actually wasting space. If you were to
  solve for the n'th Fibonacci number in your head, you'd likely only keep track
  of 2 or 3 numbers at a time: "0 plus 1 is 1, now 1 plus 1 is 2, now 1 plus 2
  is 3...". Once you've gotten the n'th Fibonacci number there's no need to keep
  anything before the n-1'th number around in memory! This method is called
  iteration:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">## Fibbing with Iteration
def iter_fib(n):
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError('Fibonacci sequence starts at first number.')
    elif n <= 2:
        return n-1 # first = 0, second = 1
    else:
        prevprev = 0
        new = 1
        for _ in range(2, n):
            prev = new
            new = prevprev + prev
            prevprev = prev
        return new
    
# Similar timing code to above produces:
# >> iter_fib(10) took average of 1.13E-06s across 10000 runs

iter_fib(10)
# >> 34
</code></pre>

<p>This is as good as it gets: O(n) time and O(1) space.</p>

<h2>Method 5: Hack Computer (Nand2Tetris)</h2>
<p>
  The Fibonacci sequence also came up in Nand2Tetris as a debugging program for
  my VM translator in Rust! While I can't show an easy example, it does serve to
  illustrate the idea for the VM Translator.
</p>

<p>
  This is the "Virtual Machine Code" for a Fibonacci sequence. It is much like
  an
  <a href="/2019/11/09/recurse-06-(intermediate-representations).html"
    >LLVM intermediate representation</a
  >, but in the virtual machine language created by the Nand2Tetris team.
