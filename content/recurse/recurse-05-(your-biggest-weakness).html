  <a href="https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/">80,000 Hours</a> is a non-profit
  that researches the world's most pressing problems and provides guidance on
  how to make an impact on them with your career. Apart from the whole "saving
  the world" focus, what I love about their basic premise is that
  <span class="italic">your career matters</span>.
</p>

<p>
  Not only does it matter to you, who will be the one living it out every day
  and week and month for approximately 80,000 hours, but it matters to the world
  what you do. The world will be affected by our existence. We can choose how we
  effect it - did we make some company money serving ads, or did we meaningfully
  contribute to improving wellbeing in our world?

  All this to say, it's important that each of us spend a lot of time thinking
  about who and what we're working for. This thought process prominently plays
  out during the interview process, when we actually have to decide between
  competing priorities. How much do we care about impact, culture, money,
  balance, benefits, and location? These decisions get made by and for us during
  the interview process.

<p>Why RC is the best place to go through an interview process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Access to a full-time support staff with your best interests in mind and
    connections to many awesome partner companies
  </li>
  <li>Time allocation is super flexible</li>
  <li>
    A large peer community that is going through similar stresses and thought
    processes about employment
  </li>
  <li>24/7 sound-proof rooms to have phone/video calls</li>
</ul>

<p>Why RC is the worst place to go through an interview process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    INTERVIEW PROCESSES CUT IN TO THE 12 SHORT WEEKS AVAILABLE TO LEARN COOL AND
    INTERESTING THINGS!!!
  </li>
</ul>

  All this to say that I spent much of last week preparing for interviews and
  doing interviews. This took precedence over project 6 of Nand2Tetris and
  various other projects I had on the go.

  Luckily, I was able to learn much about bitwise puzzles and

  while studying for interviews.
