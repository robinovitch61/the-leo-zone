title: Recurse 01 (logic immunity)

<p>
  I have been learning about basic computer architecture (logic gates) and
  working on a herd immunity simulation.
</p>

<p>
  Computer architecture work has come from the awesome
  <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">Nand2Tetris course</a> by Shimon
  Schocken and Noam Nisan. Shimon has
  <a
    href="https://www.ted.com/talks/shimon_schocken_the_self_organizing_computer_course?language=pt"
    >a fantastic Ted Talk about the course</a
  >
  and many Recursers have done it in the past. I'm 2 projects in to the first
  half of the course (<a
    href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome"
    >Coursera link</a
  >)
</p>

<p>
  The premise is that you start with a <code>Nand</code> ("Not And") logic gate.
  The first project, you build other elementary logic gates from the
  <code>Nand</code> gate (e.g. <code>Not(x) = x Nand x</code>, furthermore
  <code>x And y = Not(x Nand y)</code>; etc.) The 12th and last project, you
  complete the operating system that you have built up from the
  <code>Nand</code> gate, with the 10 projects in between filling in all the
  gaps. You could build tetris (or any similar game) in the completed computer
  you have built "from scratch".

  I am excited to keep digging in to the course. At 1 project per week, I'll
  complete the course just in time! I've heard the last 6 projects are more time
  intensive than the first 6, so I'm trying to budget time accordingly.
</p>

<p>
  The other thing I've been sinking time into is a prototype herd immunity
  simulation in python. <a href="https://github.com/haack">Alex Haak</a> and I
  are both excited about interactive data visualization and illustrating
  concepts through interactive online experiences. Our ultimate goal is to
  publish something on
  <a href="https://explorabl.es/">explorabl.es - Explorable Explanations</a>.
  This site is mind blowing. Don't visit it if you don't have a couple hours to
  kill.
</p>

<p>
  Initial results for the simulator are really interesting! I came up with a
  simplified set of rules that give a certain level of complexity while still
  massively simplifying the real world.

  Alex and I will be working on porting a modified version of this logic in to
  an awesome interactive data visualization - Alex is great with React,
  javascript, html, css, and general design so I'm excited to learn a lot from
  him!
</p>

<p>A mostly complete set of rules for the model:</p>

<i>
  <p>
    1. Number of agents is <code>GRID_WIDTH * GRID_HEIGHT = NUM_AGENTS</code>.
    Each point in the rectangular grid is occupied by an agent.
  </p>

  <p>
    2. Agents are randomly assigned an <code>IMMUNE</code> status, either 0
    (susceptible) or 1 (immune), at the beginning.
    <code>NUM_IMMUNE_START = PERC_IMMUNE_START * NUM_AGENTS</code>
  </p>

  <p>
    3. Agents are initially randomly flagged as sick, with
    <code>NUM_SICK_START = PERC_SICK_START * NUM_AGENTS.</code> Immune agents
    cannot be initially flagged as sick.
  </p>

  <p>4. All agents that aren't immune or sick are set as initially healthy.</p>

  <p>
    5. At each timestep, agents connect with some of the agents around them,
    with probability of connecting to each agent within their
    <code>CONNECTION_DISTANCE</code> being <code>PROB_SOCIAL</code> . This
    determines the candidate pool a given agent could connect with:
  </p>

  <p class="indent">
    If <code>CONNECTION_DISTANCE = 1</code>, agents have a candidate pool of <=
    8, that is, the agents directly around them in a square with themself at the
    center.
  </p>

  <p class="indent">
    If <code>CONNECTION_DISTANCE = 2,</code> agents have a candidate pool of <=
    16, that is, the agents directly around them in 2 concentric squares with
    themself at the center.
  </p>

  <p class="indent">
    etc. with <br /><code
      >CONNECTION_DISTANCE <= MAX(GRID_WIDTH, GRID_HEIGHT) - 1</code
    >
  </p>

  <p>
    6. If a sick agent connects with a healthy agent who is not immune,
    probability of infection is <code>PROB_INFECTION.</code> If a sick agent
    connects with an immune agent, probability of infection is zero (could
    change later accounting for imperfect vaccination success rate).
  </p>

  <p>
    7. After infections occur, each agent has a chance to recover with
    <code>PROB_RECOVERY</code>. Sick agents then have a chance to die with
    <code>PROB_DEATH</code>.
  </p>

<p>
  Recurse continues to be a fantastic experience, albeit a little overwhelming
  in the sheer volume of knowledge and opportunities it presents! This is a
  great problem to have. I am trying to stay focused on diving in to items of
  greatest interest while not burning myself out before the 12 weeks are up.
  It's also FLYING by.
