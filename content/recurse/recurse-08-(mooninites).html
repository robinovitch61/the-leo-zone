  This week, I completed Nand2Tetris project 9,
  <a href="/2019/11/23/how-givewell-evaluates-charities-part-1.html"
    >wrote about Givewell</a
  >, and continued interview prep.
</p>

<p>
  Nand2Tetris' gets you used to programming in the high-level "Jack" programming
  language. It would be difficult (or at least, less meaningful) to write a
  compiler for a high level language that you don't really understand.
</p>

<p>
  I found it useful in that it solidified the rules of Jack and allowed me to
  project my thoughts of what the compiler would be doing to translate Jack code
  to VM Code.
</p>

<p>
  The "game" I wrote was just enough to feel like I understood the syntax of the
  language, and isn't really a game at all. I did make a Mooninite from Aqua
  Teen Hunger Force fire rockets in to a guys mouth, though! No winning or
  losing criteria were defined but it sure was fun.
