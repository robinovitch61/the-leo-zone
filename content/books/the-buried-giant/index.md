The Buried Giant is a Fairy Tale about the value of living memory, the standards of devotion, revenge, and the stories
we tell ourselves to feel better about the world. It is beautiful, devastating, and its author [Kazuo Ishiguro][author]
is a brilliant and merciless craftsman.

Axl and Beatrice live in a small community embedded in a cold English hilltop. An ambient cruelty hovers all around,
seemingly related to the collective inability for anyone to remember what has happened. Everyone forgets even
significant events from a few minutes ago.

Axl and Beatrice, being old, are affected less by this mist of forgetfulness than the young. They show each other
exquisite tenderness despite their harsh environment. Lack of detailed memories from their decades together doesn't
affect their confidence in their love for one another.

One day, they set off to visit their son in a neighboring town, and end up on a heroic, dark and winding journey, full
of knights and monks and ogres and dragons, discovering the cause of the forgetfulness and changing the world forever.

After a series of books (The Wind Up Bird Chronicle, Enlightenment Now) that I could not finish due to a combination of
length, density and stress from a recent move, I tore through The Buried Giant in a few days. My Mom reminded me of its
existence and that I had loved it in college during a recent visit, and it was so strange to reread this book that has
memory at its center, remembering so little about it myself.

**There are massive spoilers from here on! I highly recommend reading this book without spoilers!**
