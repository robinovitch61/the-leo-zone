Rating:üò≠

[The Buried Giant][book] is a Fairy Tale about the value of living memory, the limits of devotion, the contradictions of
revenge, and the stories we tell ourselves to feel better about the world. It is equal parts beautiful and devastating,
and its author [Kazuo Ishiguro][author] is a brilliant, merciless craftsman.

Axl and Beatrice live in a small community embedded in a cold English hilltop. An ambient cruelty hovers all around,
seemingly related to the collective inability for anyone to recall the past. Everyone forgets pretty much everything,
even significant events from a few minutes ago.

Axl and Beatrice, being old, are affected less by this mist of forgetfulness than the young. They show each other warm
tenderness despite their harsh environment. Lack of detailed memories from their decades together doesn't affect their
confidence in their love for one another.

One day, they set off to visit their son in a neighboring town, and end up on a heroic, dark and winding journey, full
of knights and monks and ogres and dragons, discovering the cause of the forgetfulness and changing the world forever.

After a series of books (The Wind Up Bird Chronicle, Enlightenment Now) that I could not finish due to a combination of
length, density and mental distraction from a recent move, I tore through The Buried Giant in a few days. My Mom
reminded me of its existence during a recent visit. I went from thinking I'd never heard of it to distant memories of
having loved it. It was so strange to reread this book that has memory at its center, but remembering so little about it
myself.

**There are massive spoilers from here on! I highly recommend reading this book without spoilers!**

\- Sweet Time, Porter Robinson

How do these characters live with a terrible past, or an imminently awful future? Would it be better to forget about
what was and what's coming? Even without the mist from a dying dragon, in our real world, how do we justify to ourselves
the pain that we been complicit in and the inevitable decline and death in our future?

There are no heroes in this story. Everyone is noble and skilled in their own way, but also remarkably human. Doubt,
fear, spite, self-deception, and pettiness is interleaved with individually heroic acts. Even the bad stuff - spurring a
horse, making a child promise to hate, and unleashing a terrible war - all has good intentions and understandable roots.

You see characters use the forgetful mist to their psychological benefit throughout. Sir Gawain repeatedly downplays his
misdeeds: his role in the slaughter of Saxons during Arthur's crusade, turning the warrior over to the corrupt Abbot,
even seeming to forget that he is Querig's protector and his quest to slay her is a farce. In fits of indignity, he
vocally reaffirms himself as gallant and true. Often times he is, in fact, very knightly, rescuing and helping Axl and
Beatrice repeatedly. Much like his ever present armor that simultaneously weighs him down and seems to physically hold
him together, his warped memory and self-perception is a necessary burden to mentally forge on.

Axl was told by Jonas that Beatrice had an incurable illness, but fully misremembered it as him confirming her road to
recovery.

- Biblical story/greek myth of one little mistake

Wistan:

- bullied and betrayed as a child for being a Saxon
- grew up to be powerful, with hatred in his heart
- killing the dying dragon and unleashing the dormant resentment wasn't so bad, as it was inevitable due to the way the
  trauma had been mishandled
- passing the hatred along to the next generation is his greatest sin in my mind

I thought a lot about why Axl and Beatrice aren't allowed to cross and walk the island together at the end, and my most
hopeful interpretation is that no matter the level of lifetime devotion, we all die alone. The story of walking an
island forever with your beloved is a myth. The alternative interpretation is that Axl preventing them from visiting
their son's grave is what dooms him and Beatrice to an eternity of loneliness, and that is just too cruel. There is no
deep relationship without moments of selfishness and pettiness, and Axl fully came around in the end, initiating the
final trip to see their son.

I'll end on a positive note from another book I love. Dalinar's journey in [Oathbringer] is about learning to take
responsibility for his actions. To recognize growth, change, and improvement despite the cruelness of the world and the
temptation to put justify away the hard stuff.
