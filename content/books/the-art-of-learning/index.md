What qualities do we most dislike about self help books?

A self help book usually acts like a manual for achieving above-average levels of success, wealth, positive mental
state, etc., told through parables of the author's life.

[The Art of Learning: An Inner Journey to Optimal Performance](https://www.joshwaitzkin.com/the-art-of-learning)
by [Josh Waitzkin](https://www.joshwaitzkin.com/), Chess prodigy
and [Tai Chi Push Hands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushing_hands) 2004 world champion, is a self help book, but
quite a good one.

I think that the following are some of the pitfalls that self help content fall into that makes them unlovable. I'll
briefly discuss each point, and talk about where The Art of Learning falls on each dimension.

## There is something deeply wrong with you that must be changed

* talking about how "most people fail to do X" and as a result are in "situation you probably are in right now" (a
  median life)
* needing self help implies something is wrong with you
    * some deficiency that others don't have
    * real success comes from effortlessness

## Everyone should be striving to win and acquire increasing conventional success for the majority of their life

* people have complicated relationships with competition and winning
    * parents living vicariously through their children

* ambition is not worth it
    * given the hedonic treadmill, the pleasure of living will briefly go up during an achievement or succuess, but then
      will level off back to the way it was before
    * given this, why even try to achieve?
    * Buddhist point of life is to avoid suffering - isn't striving to improve suffering?
    * There are studies showing quality of life does go up with more achievement/things


## Success as a stand-alone virtue justifies whatever actions are taken to achieve it

* get rich quick schemes that exploit others and are designed to fail
    * philosophy vs religion vs self help - self help is capitalism's philosophy and religion
    * self improvement can be non-exploitative
    * pyramid schemes, multi level marketing, crypto, the self help industry itself
    * essentially capitalistic - "everyone is just a millionaire down on their luck", but for X

## Ambitiousness is a self-defining trait and a lifestyle

* ambition is cringe
    * hearing someone talk about the hustle, even if it's the hustle for something "good", is boring and/or infuriating
    * they take themself too seriously - no humility
    * it might say something about you that you don't have similar levels of ambition
    * people talking about this in conversation usually already have some level of success/wealth/prestige, and
      famous/rich people are annoying. Out of touch (don't know price of a banana or milk, don't know why you can't just
      e.g. "blow off work and do overseas travel together"), trust fund kids who believe their wealth is merited, etc.)
    * the counter to this is "striving is virtuous in itself"

## Results are deterministic and replicable

* success is rare and random
    * those with advice deeply discount the randomness of their own achievements
    * the idea that it is all on you and your actions/choices is usually false
        * i personally take this to heart a bit too much
        * the book does a good job recognizing this and gives techniques for dealing with randomness

* what worked for them will not work for me
    * there is no perfect instructions for improvement given that results may vary
    * by definition, there can be only one winner

## The author knows something that "those Scientists" don't

* self help often promotes pseudo science, and therefore isn't real
    * power of positive thinking
    * law of attraction, the secret, etc

## The only valid point of comparison is the top of the world

* improvement vs dominance, success, winning

## What else makes the book good?

* connection across multiple domains
* a focus on the interpersonal - reverance and gratitude for family, friends, training partners, and teachers
* honesty. Recognition that
