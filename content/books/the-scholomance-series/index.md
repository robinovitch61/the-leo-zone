If you enjoyed Harry Potter, [The Magicians by Lev
Grossman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magicians_(Grossman_novel)),
or Game of Thrones, then you will probably have a great time with The Scholomance Series by Naomi Novik.

## Book 1: A Deadly Education

TODO: brief summary/setting

The series starts with the pedal to the metal. The first moments of the novel may give you the feeling that you are
reading the journal of an overly melodramatic teenage girl. Happily, this feeling is mostly absent in the rest of the
book. As you get to know El, the protagonist, through adventures and appropriate levels of exposition, she reveals
layers of depth surpassing the average Fantasy novel character.

* the world has a dim outlook and constant danger (from where to sit in the cafeteria and when to gather new magical
  supplies to hairstyles, tooth brushing rituals, and how to modify and arrange the furniture to minimize your chances
  of death
* the friendship/romance between El and Orion isn't overdone. Polar opposites. Treatment of people as people despite
  their flaws or skills. Awkwardness of teenage boys, maturity of the girls
* mental health and being in touch with nature and yourself is displayed through stories of El's mother. She always
  takes the lesser evil and would rather be exploited than make her work about money
* the monsters are gruesome and prey on the darkest fears of humanity (spiders, loss of soul, paralysis, lock in
  syndrome)
* there is no fluff. The book hops between high stakes scenarios with just enough character development and world
  building in between to allow you to care about what's happening and to who
* there is a Dune or GoT like level of intrigue and motivation-driven character development. In such an intense
  environment, every child in the school is a master of trade, barter, study of others, and hierarchy setting
