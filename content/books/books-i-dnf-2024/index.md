I spent between a third and a full half of this year "reading" two books. I put reading in quotations because in
reality, reading a book that I'm not enjoying ends up with me reading the book less and articles on my phone more. When
I'm reading a good book, I get through 10-20 pages a night before falling asleep. I went weeks to months without picking
these books up at all.

I felt some obligation to finish these books, so didn't start anything else for a while. Too long. 2025 rule is that if
something is slow for longer than a week, I'm on to the next book.

Anyway, the two books that occupied too much of my reading time this year are:

1. The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, by Haruki Murakami

I read this book in high school and recall liking it. I remembered how brutal parts of it were, but not how long it was
and slow a lot of it is. About a third of the way in, I dropped it.

2. One Hundred Years of Solitude, by Gabriel García Márquez

I loved the first half of this book, then I had a stressful month of moving and when I fully refocused on this book, I
found that I'd lost the plot. All the characters started to be named after other characters and the weirdness got less
delightful. [This reddit thread][reddit] provides some interesting perspectives and makes me feel a bit better.

So what did I learn this year? I probably should avoid Magical Realism. If I'm not loving the book, drop it. I'm very
sucked in to my current read, and it's very refreshing.
