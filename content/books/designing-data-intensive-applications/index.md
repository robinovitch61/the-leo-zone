[Designing Data Intensive Applications][book] _(DDIA)_ is a book by [Martin Kleppmann][author].

How do I review this incredible reference? I'll first say that if you program professionally, you should read this book.
It will introduce you to new ideas and help you clarify and reconceptualize ones you may already be familiar with. You
are very likely to find relevance to your work in multiple chapters. You can view my [abridged notes in Notion
here][notes] if you'd like.

In the rest of this review, I'll cherry pick a few of the experiences and learnings I took away from this book. I lead a
book club for it at Voltus, and we took it really slowly, reading it over ~8 months. It was a 2023 goal of mine to
finish the book, and I think leading the book club helped somewhat with accountability for it. That being said, very few
others stuck with it throughout, and I think that actually reading this whole book is a serious commitment not to be
taken lightly. There is a lot of rich content to get through. You also have to decide how many side quests to go on,
e.g. "should I pause here in the Distributed Consensus section and go play with toy implementations of Paxos and/or
Raft, or should I keep reading?". I don't claim to remember and understand deeply every topic in DDIA. But it did
further my understanding across a variety of domains, give concrete justification for certain "accepted practices" that
I'd previously taken at face value, and

- was an annual goal of mine to read this this year
- the first few chapters alone are insanely valuable, particularly 2 and 3
- introduced me to completely new concepts as well as helped me reimagine ones I already understood well
  - for example, kafka-style is REALLY not the only way to do event streaming
- book club'd at work -- made me rethink the effectiveness of book clubs somewhat due to low turnout, but was also a
  great thing for my own accountability
