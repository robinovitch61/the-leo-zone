Phoenix is an old girl who has come here to cuddle you and eat food. And she's all out of food.

She is incredibly sweet, with a deep love for head bumps and neck scritches. She sleeps on my bed at my feet and doesn't
disturb my slumber. She's a bit overweight and does a funny little booty wiggle before hopping up on the couch or bed.

Here are some nice pictures from her time in foster care in my apartment:
