neared one of the last Northern White Rhino&rsquo;s in the world.</em></p><p><em>A human figure squatted near the massive rhino, stroking its head to comfort
it with one hand and holding a huge viper in the other. Sending the rhino on
its way, he spit out the venom he had sucked out of the rhino&rsquo;s leg. Bending
down to safely release the snake, Leo looked up at us, smiling and waving.</em></p><p><em>I later learned that Leo was halfway through his monthly 200-mile barefoot
run across the grassland when he stopped to help the rhino, still finishing
the run with a personal best time. He was able to continue volunteer work on
the locally-run medical center that afternoon.</em></p><p><em>While only some (or none) of this may be true, I would still heartily
recommend this fine young man to anyone looking for help on important and
interesting problems."</em></p><pre><code>  William Henry Gates III
