It was a particularly disappointing read for
me because of how much I enjoyed <a href=/books/snow-crash>Snow Crash</a> last month.</p><p>The Diamond Age should be called The Rough (Unpolished) Diamond, as this could have been a great book. Imagining what a
post-scarcity world full of accessible nanotechnology and universal 3D &ldquo;matter printers&rdquo; looks like is cool!</p><p>But the story just whipped around between these vignettes. I never really knew who to care about, and if a character
had been around long enough that it seemed like I probably should care about them, I just&mldr;didn&rsquo;t? I was never
particularly excited to return to the book, and it took me a long time to read because of my general apathy towards
the story.</p><p>Skull guns - cool. Blood-based electro-mites creating mega-consciousness collectively designing the next generation
of matter creation - sweet. Storybooks teaching a teen about Turing machines through interactive castle-based
puzzles - wicked.</p><p>Teenage rape (again) and not-so-subtle mentioning of how hot/perfect young girls are - Jesus, dude. Underground orgies
culminating in spontaneous combustion - somehow boring? Another main character wielding a sword - less cool the second
time around. Unrelated characters interacting in ways that are meant to be but don&rsquo;t feel meaningful, grim settings I
can&rsquo;t (or don&rsquo;t care to) imagine fully, and a general lack of a thread - painful.</p></div></div></div><footer><div class=nav><a href=/ target=_self>home</a></div><div class=woopsy>measure twice, cut once</div></footer></body></html>
