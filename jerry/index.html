      <p>I wanted a cat. My new apartment allowed them, and they are pretty neat. A friend recommended Jerry, a 15 year
        old orange boy from the SPCA. I had already applied for him.</p>

      <p>Prior Jerry adoption applicants had been deterred by his various medical conditions.
        Stage one kidney failure, heart murmur, just had some teeth pulled and benign lumps removed...sounds like
        a hassle.</p>
      <p>Due to some combination of being an obviously better person and obviously much more ignorant than those people,
        these issues did not deter me.</p>
      <p>Our first meeting, I thought he looked like a mythical dragon, with the sun reflecting off his green eyes. He
        walked over my lap, accepted some pets, and went back to lay in the sun.</p>
      <p>He had three previous owners. One woman got him as a kitten, then returned him shortly after. Then he lived
        with an older gentlemen for over a decade, outliving him. After his death, his kids attempted to care for Jerry,
        but apparently kept him outside (he was an indoor cat) and weren't super happy, so back to the SPCA for round
        three.</p>

      <p>Jerry spent his first day at home mostly behind the toilet. He ventured out to explore the bathtub, and slowly,
        the rest of the apartment, running back to the safety of his behind-the-toilet cavern when necessary.</p>
      <p>Portions of his front legs and shoulder were shaved from his benign lump removal surgeries.</p>

        in some sort of pet VR-Chat situation.</p>

      <p>Jerry was a great source of entertainment. I'll miss sitting on the floor with friends and letting him wander
        amongst the limbs and laps. He loved Tai's sock smell on this day maybe more than Hot Taki dust. Madi and
        Meital's socks, not as much, for reasons unknown.</p>

      <p>Barbara and Andrew were absolute legends of cat sitters, living with Jerry for a whole month so that I could go

        anyone else I'm forgetting who provided Jerry with excellent care while I was away.</p>

    <p>Jerry's Chronic Kidney Disease progressed through stage four, and eventually it became clear that it was his
      time.</p>
    <p>I'm comforted knowing that his suffering is over, and that we had a good last year together.</p>
    <p>Thank you to Eva for providing him hydrating fluids over the last few weeks, Dr Lee, Dr Whitmer and others
      at the SPCA for providing him great medical care, Georgie for being very supportive in the final weeks of
      his life, and A Gentle Rest who gave him the best end possible.</p>
    <p>If you have pictures or stories of Jerry, please email them to me.</p>
    <p>Thank you all for being a part of Jerry's life ❤️!</p>
